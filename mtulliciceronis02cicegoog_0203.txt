rei publicae disciplina. quid? Cyrenaeum Theodorum, philo-
sophum non ignobilem, nonne miramur? cuicum Lysimachus
rex crucem minaretur, Istis quaeso, inquit, ista horribilia
sminitare purpuratis tuis; Theodori quidem nihil inter·

moneor, ut aliquid etiam de humatione et sepultura dicendum

form Spartani, but heis not correct in
making the Spartiatae the inhabitants oi
the city ol Sparta and Lacedaenronii those
oi all Laconia. The inhabitants of La-
conia were Σπαρτιᾶται, Περίοικοι, and
dilores-Lacedaemonii in Cicero, as
Λακεδαιμόνιοι commonly in Greek, ap-
lies to all inhabitants oi Laconia, but
§partiatae ln Cic. denotes members of
the dominant race, just as it does in
Thucydides, ci. (inter alia) Thuc. iv 38,
5 rai Σπαρτιᾶται τούτων ἦσαν τῶν ζώντων
περὶ εἴκοσι καὶ ἕκατον. See Gilbert, op.
cit. p. 38 11. 1 (E.T.).

rei publicae disciplina, ‘national
trainingss

cyrenaeum: the adjectives which de·
note schools of philosophy end so com·
monly inicus, and Cic. has so often
used the iorm Cyrenaici to denote this
school (cf. 34, 83), that Reid is probably
right in departing from the mss in Ac. ii
24, 76. We may either suppose that the
mss here also are in error or else take
Cyrenaeas, with some editors, to mean
‘native oi Cyrene.’ In the latter case
we should still have a point in the word,
C yrenaeus l( Spartiates, and it is probable,
though not certain, that Th. was born in
Cyrene. The adj. is in any case em-
phatic by position.

For Theodorus the Cyrenaic‚ sumamed
ἄθεος, cf. Diog. L. ii ἐξ 98 soll. It is
not certain, as stated by some editors,
that he was put to death by poison by
Lysimachus. Cic. in v 40, 177 refers to
a threat with regard to such a death ; cf.
cantharidis uim there.

otti: attracted into the rel. clause, ci.
34, 84 n. on ‘qui...si ante occidissemus'

Lysimachus: one oi the generals oi
Alexander who, after gaining much of
Asia and all the European domini0ns of
that monarch, ultimately sell at Coru-

pedion in 281 B.c., defeated by Seleucus.

eum minaretur: the subj. refers to
our thought (nonna miramuril.

horribilia: Cic. would scarcely have ’
used this word as a noun ii he were not
translating from the Greek. [Rather the
use as noun is eased by its occurrence
with ista ; it may even be that horribilia
is still regarded as adj.. ista being sub·
stantival.]

purpuratis, ‘high officers,’ ‘courtiers‚'
cs. Cat. iv 6, 12 ‘regnantem Lentulum...

purpuratum esse huic Gabinium '; Juv.

iv 3¹ ‘purpureus...scurra palati.‘ Livy
xxxiii 8, 8 ‘Nicanori, ex purpuratis uni!

humine an sublime: ὑπὲρ ’γῆς ἢ ὑπὸ
γῆς. Plutarch 499 d. The paronomasia
is noted by TS.

sttttblima: 17, 40 n. Here an adverb
o rest.

numnam: so GRE and other MSS
here, and the best tiss in N.D. ii 64. 160.
For the distinction between patesco (pu-
risco> ‘rot,’ and putresca ‘crumble away,’
cl. Nonius putidum, non putrem, sed
odoris mali, quoted by Madv. on putis-
ceret Fin. v 13, 38 where see his note.

euius hoc dici0=quo huius dictat Lat.
writers prefer to bring the person to the
lront of the clause. From this point to
the end aig 108 we have a digression
with reference to erroneous views com·
monly prevalent with regard to burial and
funeral rites.

admoneor...ut dicandum existimem:
almost=admonear ut dr'cam or admonear
dicendum csse. ‘Prompted by this utter-
ance of Th. I think that Ι ought....'

humatio differs irom sepultura as the
particular from the general term. ‘In-
terment and modes of disposing of the
dead’ cf. sepeliri below §1033 sepul·
turam 45, 108. Also Tac. Hist. i 47
sepultura l( cremari.
