Ι have to express my deep sense of the kindness and
courtesy which Ι invariably experienced from the Librarians of
the several libraries in which the MSS which Ι have collated are
preserved. '

Since the MS of this work was accepted by the Cambridge
University Press it has been read through by my friend,
Prof. J. S. Reid, who has contributed those explanatory notes
which are enclosed in square brackets, My indebtedness to
Dr Reid dates from my undergraduate days. It would be
difficult to estimate how much I owe to the lectures and tuition
then received from him and to his published works, especially to
his masterly edition of the Academics, the work which intro·
duced me to the study of ancient philosophy.

My best thanks are due to my friend and former pupil‚

’ Prof. R. K. M'Elderry, MA, for much assistance in the revision
of the proofs of this work as it passed through the press; also
to my friend and former pupil‚ Mr R. M. Henry, MA, for notes
acknowledged in the commentary; and to both gentlemen for
the detection of several oversights that otherwise would probably
have escaped my notice.

The labour of revision, necessarily heavy at the best in a
work involving so many references was considerably lightened
owing to the marked efficiency of the readers at the Cambridge
University Press
