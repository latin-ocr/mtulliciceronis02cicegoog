wanted however is that of sff„ ie. ‘which
of the two it is I do not know,’ for he
goes on to say lower down ‘but whether
it is air or whether it is fire I would
swear that it is divine'

ut letos: i.e. all those who, like the
Stoics, held positive doctrines about the
composition of the soul.

noo me pudet...fateri amatre: sor the
omission of me before nescire cf. Madv.
§4013 Roby§ 1346. A personal pronoun
as subject acc. is sometimes omitted before
an infin„ if unemphatic‚ especially when
it hasbeen expressed with the verb upon
which the infin. dep'ends‚ and that verb is
a verb of saying or thinking. Cf. Or. iii
46, 147 ‘uel me licet existimes desperare
ista posse perdiscere’3 Nl). i 39, 109
‘puderet me dicere non intellegere’

qnod nesciam, ‘anything that I do not
know'; for the subj. see Madv. §364
obs. r; cf. Ac. ii 25, 81 ‘at ille nescio
qui, quiin scholis nominari solet, mille
et octoginta stadia quod abesset uidebat,'
where Reid notes ‘subjunctive due to the
class-notiom’

fflnd does not go with orlfirmorc but,
somewhat loosely, with iurarem. The
word is required for emphasis.

adfirmare, ‘to make a positive asser·
tion’; this Cic, as a follower of the N ew
Academy‚ could not do, ci. Ac. ii 3, 8
‘nos (Academici) probabilia multa habe·
mus, quae sequi facile, adfirmare uix
possumus.’ See also T.D. ii a, 5. pos·
scm of the MSS is therefore right.

siue ranis ut: for the tense, sor which,
coming as it does between possem and
iurarem and being subordinate to iurarem,
we might have expected the imperfect
by attraction, cf. Fin. i 7, 25 ‘nam si
concederetur, etiam si ad corpus nihil
referatur, ista sua sponte et per se esse
iucunda, per se osset et uirtus et cognitio
rerum, quod minime ille uolt, expetenda,'
where see Madv. who adds ‘Videtur
ipsam rem controuersam uniuersius elo·
qui uelle! Cf. also Diu. ii 59, 122 ‘atqui‚
ne si nauigare quidem uelim, ita guber-

narem, utsomniauerim.’ See also Draeger,
Hist. Synt. 1¹ ἓ 151 h, adfinem. Except
in the case oi indirect questions dependent
upon a non-fulfilled protasis or apodosis,
the principle (of attraction) is subJect to
numerous exceptions. Sff. re-wrote this
passage as follows: ‘illud‚ si nlla alia de
re obscura, adfirmare possum, siue anima
siue ignis sit animus, eom iurare me esse
diuinam.' But possum adfirmare iurare
meisa strange mode of expression, and
no correction is necessary. Cic. has been
speaking of montorio, it is true, but
animus includes memoria, and he there·
fore makes his assertion with regard to
animus. Moreover the argument along
here is that the animus, since it contains
such marvellous faculties, memory ond
others (cf. ἓ 61 note on ‘quid illa uis’),
must be immortal.

qnid enim introduces, as often, a
reductio ad absurdum. So quid zgr'tur
(561) and quid crgo, often. The ex·
pressiori is equivalent to neque enim
terra...concreta tibi medebitur ronta uir
memoriae. Kuh.

terrem tini huc: Or. with vulg. read
tibi out hoc, which seems to bave no us
authority. The insertion of aut arose
from a desire to find a separate mention
of the fourth clement, aqua. But Cic. in
this sentence summarlly rejects the two
elements osdownward tendency (cf. ἕ 42),
and the dense lower air as well, leaving
only pure anima and ignis as the possible
components of the soul. [Probably e ter·
rone should be read here. Cf. cx hacine
terrena natura concreta and 5 66.]

terra l( diuino quodam principio.

hoo nebuloso et caliginoso caelo,
‘with this watery and misty atmosphere.'
The constr. is abl. abs. giving the at·
tendant circumstances (comitative use of
abl), cf. 5, 10 n. on ‘maxima corona';
