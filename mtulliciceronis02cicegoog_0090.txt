state.

Kuh. warmly supports Bentley’s emend·
ation mors (wh. is also the reading, by
correction, of the Vatican ms), taking
the corruption to have been caused by
the following miserum. But though mors
might be more strictly accurate Cic. may
not have expressed himself with perfect
accuracy here.

ln utta: if we punctuate as in the text
with Ml.. we must explain as Anon. in
Mo. as=cum uitam accineremus (rather
cum uitam haberemus). Bai. Hei. TS.
bracket these words. Kiih. takes them
with what follows, putting the semi-colon
after haberemus. But though he finds in
the contrast to sempiternum a special fit·
ness in the emphatic position thus secured
for the words it does not seem natural.

aloem: a straight line drawn with
chalk or pipe-clay across the floor of the
circus to mark the finishing point; de·
cursum continues the metaphor from the

epicharmus was born at Cos but
brought to Sicily when young or went
there at a later date.

ut moult: lit. ‘as being a Sicilian ' ; nt
, (cf. Gk ὡς) does not imply anything as
to whether the Sicilians were witty or
not. They were, as a matter of fact,
reputed witty, cf. Verr. iv 43, 95 ‘num-

uam tam male est Siculis quin aliquid
lacete et commode dicant’; also Brut.
ιι, 46. Here therefore the meaning is
‘witty‚ as a Sicilian might be expected
to be,' cf. 43, 104 ‘Diogenes ut Cynicus,
proici se iussit inhumatum) lt is equally
common for ut to receive from the con·
text a restrictive force, cf. Cato M. 4, 12
‘multae etiam, ut in homine Romano.

acts enlm: ie. Cic. translates the ex·
tracts from Greek writers and avoids
foisting in any Greek, the more so as
his philosophical works are intended for
readers assumed to be little acquainted
with Greek literature. In writing to

Atticus, his purpose being different, he ·

introduces Greek freely.

(nihil) with aestimo perhaps occurs only
here. Ml. and Schiche may be right in
altering to nihili.
