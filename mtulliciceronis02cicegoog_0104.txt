(a) The natural effect oi qur'dam is to
add oagreeness. Oiten the word has no
further effect, e.g. ii 4, ιο ‘a tali quodam
ductus exordio.’

(bl lt is fitted ior apologising. as here,
ior the use oi a word in a metaphorical
sense, ci. i ao, 46 ‘uiae quasi quaedam’;
ii 6, 16 ‘quaedam generosa uirtus!

(c) With words oi a certain class its
effect is to intensisy their meaning: the
imagination makes a vague sear a great
sear, ag. ii 4, ro ‘metus quidam,' or a
thing vaguely great very great, eg. i η,
66 ‘singularis quaedam.'

(d) ln i 40, 95 ‘magnis quibusdam
bonis' the use is really the same as in
singularis quaedam, but the added vagne-
ness shews that ntagnis is sarcastically
used, and hence the effect is deiparagiug.
Similarly in ii 4, rr ‘excelsum quendam
uidelicet' the irony is heightened. See
also ii aa, 5² ‘opinio est enim quaedam,¹
and note there.

quan: as osten, marks a translation,
cf. ao, 46 n.; 24, 57 n. ‘quasi consigna·
tas’; also aa, 52 ‘quasi uas aut receptacu-
lum’3 28, 683 ii 4, 113 ii 25, 61. What
the Greek expression was is uncertain.
Mr R. M. Henry suggests ἀποδήμησιν καὶ
μετεμψύχωσιν. But as it was very usual
for Cic. to translate a single Greek word
by two Latin expressions, perhaps only
one oi these Greek words is referred to.
Mr Henry adds that uitae is objective
gen, μετεμψ. being=the entrance upon
(ἐν) an altered (uer-l liie3 and that the
antecedent to quae is uitae3 the follow-
ing subjunctives being generic, ‘a change
to a life which in men and women of
renown is osten the pathway to the sky,
while in meaner mortals it is confined
to earth and yet (tanuen) persists un·

But some of the difficulties disap ear
aiter one remembers the ambiguity oi) the
word mors which bears different shades oi
meaning, as (r) the actual moment oi
severance from lise, (a) the process that
leads up to the severance (‘dying'), (3)
the state or condition resulting from the
severance, while (a) and (3) are some·
times combined as here in the application
oi mors to migratio commutatioque uitae]

migrationem commutationemque ui-
aaa: this passage is difficolt. sn. takes
mors to be the subject ol retineretur. We
should then have to take mors in its strici
sense with dux iu caelum soleret esse and
as=mortui with retineretur. Hei. appears
to take uita as the subject; but to say .
that uita byitself is dux in caelum would
be to make a strange assertion. Or. and
others take the subject to be commutatio
uitae=uita conmutata (abstract sor con·
cretel. The change in their lise ushers
the good into heaven—so many philo·
sophers held; ci. Plaio's view that the
souls of the good possed to the outer rim
of the universe-while in the case oi the
rest it, i.e. the nr'ta contorutata, i.e. the
animus a corpore scitantur, is down in
the ground (i in Hades or haunting the
tomb) but still alive. Sff. and K'uh read
ut permanerent tarnen.

§aa Romulus...: a line from Ennius,
more correctly given hy Servius on Aen.
vi 764 ‘Romulus incaelo cum disgenitali·
bus aeuom degit.’

indeque perlapsus: ‘passing thence
to us.’ Cf. the story oi Hercules and
Cacus, Livy i 73 Virg. Aen. viii
190 etc.

Oceanum: the Atlantic, where were
the Ἡρακλέους στῆλαι. Davies notes
that Hercules was worshipped at Gades
and that that place uras regarded as the
end oi the world, comparing (iuter alia)
