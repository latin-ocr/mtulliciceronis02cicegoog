INTRODUCTION Ι xxxv

G4. 4, ·13 trs Aug. 4 “Membranaceus in quarta saec. XV in
Italia exaratus. Graecis locis uacum spatium relr'ctum est.'' Quoted by
Or. Mo. and Kiih. as Aug. Contains T.D. only. This us does not
end at the end of c. 21 Bk v as Kiih. asserts. He confuses it with
G3 (his Gud. 11), which seems to end there. See above.

Gr. This ns was used by J. M. Brutus lor the Tusculans in his
edition of all Cicero published in 1570 in 9 vols. hy Antonius Gryphius
at Lyons. There is a copy os this edition in the Imperial Library at
Vienna, 45 Aa 36. Ι know os no other which is complete. The
Tusculans are in vol. 1. Ι have taken the readings os Gr from this
edition. Some volumes are in the University Library at Leyden but
vol. 1 is missing. The ns is probably lost. It is ¹not known to be
identical with any existing ns. The data given by Brutus seem scarcely
sufficient to enable us to decide positively whether such identification is
possible or not.
