excursus ιι 243

since Cic. knew that, though Plato employed it in the Phaedo (78 c), he elsewhere
made the soul triplex (cf. ιο, nom).

The argument from ἀνάμνησις requires the assumption that pre-existence is a proof
of immortality (for which assumption cf. Lactantius iii ι8 non putauerunt aliter
fieri posse ut supersint animas pos! mortem nisi uideantur fuisse ante corpora). This
may perhaps to some extent account for the fact that though Cic. states the doctrine
of ἀνάμνησις he does so with so little sympathy that his words taken literally,
represent the boy to have answered the questions on geometry because they were very
easy, not because he possessed ἀνάμνησις. And he confuses tuduinum with μνήμη,
using the same word (memoria) for both; and when he has got rid of ἀνάμνησις he ,
takes up feats of memory as if these were something higher (cf. §59 maiore ettam
quodam modo) and afforded stronger proof of his point. The argument from the
Scale of Existence is treated in the same desultory manner. It seems plainly to be
implied‚for otherwise the reference to the lower faculties does not contribute anything
to the general argument, since there was no question of the immortality of the vital
principle of plants, or of the ψυχὴ dhrym of auimals, involved in the discussion. The
appetites and aversions attributed in this section to the animus belong to the ψυχὴ
ἄλογοι of Plato and, so far as they are not under the control of reason, they are not a
part of the Stoic ψυχή. ln Nm. ii ιι, ²9 they are more correctly referred to:
‘habere in se aliquem principatum ut in homine mentem, in belua qurildam simile
mentis, unde orrizntur rerum appetitus.¹ For the Stoic soul with its dominant part,
reason, and its seven derivative powers, see 18, 42 n. on siue dissipantur. The Stoic
view with regard to the emotions and desires is given in Diog. L. vii ιιι foll. They
are κρίσεις, judgments or opinions formed by the mind: λύπη is an irrational con·
traction of the mind; φόβος is expectation of evil; ἐπιθυμία is an ἄλογος ὄρεξις,
aud so on. They have therefore no separate seat and do not proceed from a special
faculty, but are merely wrong decisions of the imperfect soul, cf. T.D. iv 6, ιι foll.
