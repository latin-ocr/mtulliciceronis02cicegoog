lxiv INTRODUCTION

The best Mss regularly present the forms ii, iis (or lu', luris), not
ei, cis. Ezkieuz occurs once, 1165. Cf. Fleck. p. 15 3 Bramb. pp. 140,
323·

The best Mss have invariably the form cum not quom, yet the variant
cum RVGBPL for quo in u 57 would seem to have arisen from quo*
(=quum) for quo.

If we follow the Mss of the Tusculan Disputations there ean beno
doubt as to spelling Accius, not Attius, cf. 11 13. Paulus and Gracchus
are the MS forms. Also cotidie, numquam, quamquam, quendam,
quandam, quicquum, quidquid, uolgo, uolnus, uolt.

E is very commonly written fory or ae and y or ue ior e. This error
Ι have generally passed over without notice in the critical notes. y The
erroneous spellings caeteros in G 1 114 and uteris in B1143 are very
noticeable in Mss of such early dates.
