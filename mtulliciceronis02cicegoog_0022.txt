INTRODUCTION xvii

putations were published (editis) before the books De Natura Deorum
were written (so the word perfectos seems generally understood), since
we find the collection of material for the latter work begun on the
5th August, we should place the date of composition of the Tusculan
Disputations between the aoth July and the 5th August. If the books
could be spoken on five afternoons they could no doubt be written
out in fifteen days. But this would have involved working twice as
fast as he worked over the writing of the De Finibus. There would
seem to be no reason for this acceleration of the rate of speed at
which he worked, and, as we shall see below that the second at least
of the books De Diuiuatioue was not written till after Caesar's death,
this theory would allow Cicero seven months and ten days for the
writing of the Do Natura Deorum, the Coto Maior, and the first book
De Diuiuatioue. As he was in or near Rome during rnost of that
time, this sudden change from double speed to a little over quarter
speed would be unaccountable, especially as we find him working fast

again during the period between the middle of March and the end of ·

October in the year 44 nc.

It is true that Cicero does not seem usually to have had more than
one philosophie work in hand at a time. The recasting of the
characters and rearranging the division into books of the Academica is

hardly an exception. But there are remarkable internal resemblances ’
between the Tusculan Disputations and the Do Natura Deorum. No

other two works of Cicero have so much in common, and I think it
. very probable that for some reason Cicero may have worked at both ·
of these subjects during the same period. And this theory, if correct,
may throw light upon the meaning of the word perficio in the passage
in De Diuiuotioue referred to above. After Cicero had got the Tusculan
Disputations off his hands by publication (editis) he proceeded to com·
plete (perfectis) the De Natura Deorum with which he had also been
occupied.

3. In Att. xv 2, 4 we find Cicero writing, on the 18th May, 44,
quod primu demutatio Tusculano te coufirmat saue gaudeo. And in Art.
xv 4, 2 on the 2 3rd May, redeamus rge'tur od Tusculanos disputationes.
These extracts shew that the work had been published before the
18th May, 44, but they do not prove, as Heine (Eiul. p. iii) and
others seem to assume, that Atticus received the book only about that
time. Cicero was very anxious at that time. ln a letter of the 4th May
he says that it was less dangerous to speak against the party of the
tyrant during his life than after his death. Atticus was also anxious,
certainly on Cicero's account, possibly on his own. Itis evident that
he had written to Cicero (mainly perhaps to fortify him) stating that he
