derisere) But appellantur is not sup-
ported in the slightest degree by λέγονται
since it does not, in Cic’s version,
represent that word. Cic, as Mo. ob·
serves, gives throughout a free, not a
close, rendering 01 the Greek. Here
the Greek says ‘ei δ’ 1ιῦ ofov ἀποδημῆσαί
ἐστιν...εὶ.,.τις εὑρήσει τοὺς ὡς ἀληθῶς...
οἵπερ καὶ λέγονται ἐκεῖ δικάζειν...’; the
hypothetica] character of these judges is
even more enrphasised in the Greek than
in Cic, ‘if that theory be true,...if one
will reach real judges, who are said to
give judgment there....' Λέγονται is not
represented in Cic. 's loose version at all,
except by sin uero sunt, quae dicuntur.

Minoem Triptolemum : the words
fall into pairs, just as do Orpheo Musaeo,

Aeacus and Triptolemus are more
closely connected with Athens, the latter
being celebrated as the inventor 01 the
plough and the first to sow grain in
Attica, and the former being famous in
connection with the neighbouring island
01 Aegina. Aeacus is not referred to in
Greek lit. as judge 01 the dead except
by Plato l. d. and in Gorg. 3130, while
Triptolemus is only referred to in the
Platonic original of the present passage.
But both are represented as just judges
on earth (cf. Hom, Hymn to Demeter
153 101 Triptolemus, and Pind. Isthm.
viii 48 for Aeacus); and this was the
circumstance that would make the meet·
ing specially interesting; cf. ‘conueni-
reque eos qui iuste...uixerint,' and in
Plato l. d. ‘ecel ἄλλοι ὅσοι...δίκαιοι ἐγέ-
νοντο ἐν τῷ ἑαυτῶν filo) Stallbaum on
Plato, here, observes ‘Quod Triptolemus
in numero iudicum inferorum ponitur ea
uidetur esse plebis Atticae opinio, quae
fortasse ex mysteriis Eleusiniis in uolgus
dimanauerat.' And, as a matter offeret,
all four heroes here mentioned were con·
nected with the secret rites or mysteries
01 their native places. See Riddell’s
note on Plato’s Apol. 41 a.

[conueniriquez que alter 1 is not so
uncommon in Cic. as is often stated3
but probably not used by Cic. in speeches
except sinique (twice) and esseque once.
