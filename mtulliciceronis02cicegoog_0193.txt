consecuti sumus, spoliati magnis quibusdam bonis, inlusi desti·
tutique uideamur. 96. quod si exspectando et desiderando
pendemus animis, cruciamur, angimur, pro di inmortales! quam

nulla sollicitudo futura sit! quam me delectat Theramenes!
quam elato animo est! etsi enim flemus cum legimus, tamen

including the best, with the notable ex· house in England, and szatas ‘pedlar'
ception of V, have inserted the words (lit. Scotchman) in Lithuania.
iussu tyrannorum from ten lines lower consecuti: 16, 36 u.

down (5 96). As it is not conceivable
that the copyists could separately make
this· mistake, the natural conclusion is
that all these Mss spring from a single
source.

mollissimis: molestissimis is the read·
ing os all the best mss, and it is worth
noting that no variant is supplied by the

γ early correctores V. Yet the objection
of Bent. that with it we should expect
cruciamur or torquemur, not efferatius·
mur, is lorcible, and modern editors
read mollissimis with most late mss and
early editions.

aduentet: often used ol the approach
of evils, Cato M. 1, a ‘onere...aut iam
urgentis aut certe aduentantis senectutis’;
Or. i 45, 199 ‘cum me uires (quod sere
iam tempus aduentat) deficere coepissent.’
Mo. But often without this implication,
especially ol troops, eg. Art. viii 3, 7
‘Afranium (a friend) cum magnis copiis
aduentare!

Chaldaeorum: for astrologers at Rome
see Mayor on Juv. x 94. Foretelling
the duration ol lite was one ol their
specialities, cf. Hor. Odes i 11, 3 ‘nec
Babylonios temptaris numeros,’ and Juv.
xiv 248 ‘nota mathematicis genesis tua.'
At this period the art. which had origin-
ated long before in the valley ol the
Euphrates (cf. Diu. i 1, al, was mainly
prosecuted by Greeks, but the original
name persisted; cl. the application os

. the word ‘Scotchman' to all who sell

dry goods, tea, etc.. from house to

sumus: it is not necessary with Or.
and other editors to change to simus
against the uss.

ments qmbusdam: quibusdam, by
its vagueness, here disparages, cf. i ra,
²7 n.

§se exspectando et conterendo:
abl. oi attendant circumstances.

animis: so the best and nearly all uss.
Ursinus read animi which he found in
his MS, and Bent. approved. Wes. Em.
iii p. ογ also thinks auinti probably
right; and it is the usual form in Cicero,
but in Livy vii 3ο, aa mss read ‘quid
illis nos sollicitis ac pendentibus animis
renuntiare iubetis?' There however
Weissenborn, after Sigonius and Gron.‚
reads animi, with great probability. See
Wes. Em. i p. 29 [Madv. Em. Le'v.
p. 180]. anirui is read in our passage
by the early corrector of V.

Theramenes: as one of the Thirty
Tyrants he ultimately opposed the
cruelty of his colleagues, especially that
ol Critias, and was condemned to death.
For his character see Grote, Hist. os
Greece, yol. v11t c. 65.

legimns: in Xen. Hell. ii 3, 36 ‘rai
ἐπεὶ γε ἀποθνήσκειν, ἀναγκαζόμενος τὸ
κώνειον ἔπιε, τὸ λειπόμενον ἔφασαν ἀπο·
κακταβίσαντα εἰπεῖν αὐτον· Κριτίᾳ τοῦτ’
ἔστω τῷ καλῷ)

miserabiliter: that famous man does
not die cum lamentatione. Hor. Carm.
i 33, ο ‘neu miserabiles decantes ele·
gos! Hei.
