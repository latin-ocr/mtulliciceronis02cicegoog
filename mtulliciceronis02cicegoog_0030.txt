INTRODUCTION

Boorc II.

There are fewer and less clear indications of the source from which
Cicero drew his material for the second book. The book contains
much pure Stoicism. Heine¹ cites the following instances:-§ 31
the doctrine that without prudentia no virtue is conceivahle‚ and
that the four cardinal virtues enjoin the endurance of pain 3 §32 that
virtue cannot be lost, and that the possession of one virtue implies the
possession of all virtues 3 ἓ 43 the definition of virtue as recta ane'eni
adfectio ; §47 the expression quae conixa perse et progressa loagr'res fit
perfecto uirtus, this being the doctrine of προκοπή ; §51 the statement
that there is no known example of the ideal wise man; §63 the same
distinction between perfecta uirtus and the opim‘o honestatis of the un-
philosophic multitude which we find in Off. iii ἓ 17. Hence a pure
Stoic source has been thought of. Kiihner² says that Chrysippus
seems to have been chiefly followed by Cicero in the first four ,
books. But Chrysippus could not have written ἓ 47 est enim animas in
partes tributus duas quorum altera rationis est parisiens, altera expers
(see explan. n. odiorum), and the criticism of Stoic syllogism could not
come from him. Hence Hirzel and Heine reject Chrysippus. Hirzel⁸
thinks Philo the source for Book 11 as well as for Book 1. Heine
objects that if Philo had employed such Stoic arguments as we find
in Book 11, and in the first part of Book 1, his contemporaries
would have set him down as a Stoic and not asan Academic.

There is more to be said in favour of Panaetius or Posidonius as
source. Panaetius wrote a letter to Tubero de dolore patiendo⁴.
Zietschmann⁵ thought this Cicero’s source. And Cicero derived his
material forde Officiis i-ii from Panaetius. But there are no facts
to connect Panaetius with the second book of the Tusculans except
the letter above referred to. Cicero was also beholden to Posidonius
for material. He had a book of Posidonius before him when writing
the third book de Offieies⁰ and probably drew more from it than the
statement in de Officiis iii 2, 8 would lead us to suppose. His probable
obligation ¹to Posidonius in the first book of the Tusculans has been
already dealt with. Bake⁷ gives good reason for believing that Cicero
drew upon the Προτρεπτικοί of Posidonius for his Hortensius. The
division of the soul into a rational and irrational part in ᾗ 47 isin
