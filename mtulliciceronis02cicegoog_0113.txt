suf similam The distinction of the (cf. Pausanias v 10 p. 397) actually in·
old grammarians ‘sum similis tui mori· scribed his name at the feet of his
bus; similis tibi figura’ has long been Olympian Zeus, many have read cum
rejected. Madv. on Fin. v 5, rr lays it inscribere nomen liceret. But Klotz,

Ι down that in Cr'c. and the older writers quoted in Kuh, notes that many ancient
the gen. is the rule and the dat. very rare statues have been discovered in Paris to
in the case of resemblance to living contain the name of the sculptorcarefully
beings‚ especially gods and men, and concealed within them with a statement
that both cases are used indifferently of that the artists were not allowed to
resemblance to things; that with Livy append their names openly. Whence
the dative becomes more and more usual Klotz conjectures that it rested with the
even of resemblance to persons, and that patron or authority, who ordered the
in Augustan poets (Virg. Hor. Ov.) the statue, to allow or forbid the inscription
gen. is scarcely found. Sh'. thinks that of the name.
Madv. does not give the ground of the sua. nomina incombunt: cf. p. Arch.
distinction, and that patris sinn'lr‘s:‘the 11, 26 for the same thought.
