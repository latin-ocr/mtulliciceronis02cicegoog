quasi uero ista ui quicquam turn potuerit ei melius accideret
quod si ante occidisset, talem euentum omnino amisisset; hoc
autem tempore sensum amisit malorum. 86. Pompeio, nostro

read tum. accidisset, retained by Tr.
and Sti, would have for its subject ista
uis, which would be absurd since ista uis
would then be subject to arrisisset and to
amisit and it is part of the mala which
it would thus be said to have escaped.
Priamus is understood as nom. to ami·
sisset and to amisit. Even if we supplied
from the context not isto uis but mors as
nom. to occidisset, this loosely supplied
nom. would, with further looseness 31
construction, be nom. to amisisset and
to omisit. occe'disset, accepted hy most
editors, involves the changing of a single
letter. The corruption was no doubt
due to the preceding accziiere. Bentley
says that ‘priscae editiones' have occi-
disset. tamen is retained by Or. Sff.
Kl. but this involves taking euentum
with rnolorum in the sense 0f ‘the oc·
currence of evils’ as contrasted with the
sensus malorum, and mantus in this sense
would be hard to parallel, though strala
euenerunt is common, cf. ξξ 86 ‘haec

mala...etiam si non euenerunt.' tum is
open to the same objections as tamen.

lf sound it can only be taken as Biller-
beck took it, as improprie quidem sed
iocose datum, a view also adopted by
Kuh. Schtttz proposed to cut out omisis-
set as a marginal gloss, 3ηά thought the
construction acase 31 zeugma ; but Mo.
(Exc. Vol. 11 p. 364) objects that it is
not usual in zeugma for 3 verb to be
omitted which must be supplied in a
different mood and different tense.

Sall. lug. 14, 23 ‘nonenim regnum,

'aerumnas curn anima simul amisisti‚'

quoted by Hei. and earlier by Olivet, is
not parallel to our passage3 for, as Mo.
observes, in aerumnas amittere only one
word is used minus proprie and the use
is explained by the use of another‘word,
sensu proprio, but 11313 we have a double
κατάχρησις, euentum amittere and serarum
omittere malorum. Ι 3111 therefore not
satished that the reading which l have
followed is what Cicero actually wrote,
and Ι think the emendation of Hottinger‚
adopted by Mo„ talem euentum omnino
non habuisset very prolsable. Hottinger
supposed non (ni) to have fallen out
after -no in omnino and then habuisset,
become meaningless, to have been al·
tered into arrisisset. He compares Diu.
