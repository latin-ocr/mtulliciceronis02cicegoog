INTRODUCTION xxxi

probably spring from the same archetype as Ψ, seems to me to be fully
borne out by the readings that 1 have recorded from those Mss that
I have placed in group β.

The ns originally consisted of 97 leaves of parchment. A portion
of the end of Book v, which had suffered damage, was subsequently re·
copied on two more leaves. The original copyist had added at the end
M. Tulli Ciceronis Τ usculaurum (sic) liber V explicit feliciter, and below
this another hand had written Contulimus (Stroebel, p. 49).

A note on a ily-leaf at the beginning shews that the ns is one of
those presented to the Vatican Library by Fulvio Orsini (in 1600 nm),
and that it had earlier belonged to the famous humanist Antonio Becca-
delli, known as Panormita (1394-1471 nn).

This ns rivals R and G in excellence. In the following places it is
right where the best mss are wrong: '

14 grecie, with others3 1 42 uidetur, with many others, 1 88 ne
carere quidem3 195 ponamus, without iussu tyrannorum 11 31 debilitari
dolore 3 11 39 ecfari V B alone; et fari E.

11 48 ac ad custodia is read by Ψ and E alone (this being the
nearest to what seems the right reading). In 11 62 contemndo seems
nearer the true reading, and a more faithful attempt to copy the true
reading than contempno of Rl G P¹. See Int'rod. p. xlviii.

V was copied from an excellent source, but that source was very
closely related to the sources of all the best existing ross. It has been
corrected, very soon after it was written, by another hand, and the
corrections, which are obviously right in a remarkably large number
of instances, derive special value from the fact that their source was
only very remotely related to the sources of the best known MSS.

Ψ alone has the right reading in :-1 5 carbonem3 1 7 scientia, 1 20
parere, and perhaps ci preceding3 1 81 dissimilitudines, 1 98 iudicio
iniquo circumuent013 1 110 e boeotiu5 1 116 qui item oraculo; 11 2 si non
,tantos; 11 5 transferant (R7 very nearly the same) 3 ιι 16 dicerem 11 30
aspernetur ς ι 116 olclridamas (l should be absent, but no other ins has
the correct termination).

Ψ has the right reading in 1 3 quingentis, with ΚΟ 9 alone; 1 20
