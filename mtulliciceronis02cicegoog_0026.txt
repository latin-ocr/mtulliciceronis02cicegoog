INTRODUCTION xxi

for the first book of the Tusculan Disputations very conflicting opinions
have been held.

P. Corssen¹ thought that Posidonius was marked out as the source
for the entire book by the many facts which we know with regard to the
views of Posidonius, and by the predominance of Stoic lore throughout
the book.

Rudolf Hirzel' thought the Stoic views so vague and general that
Cicero could have developed them himself 3 that much that coincides
with Posidonius' known views may be common property of all philo·
sophers3 that Cicero's work throughout is that of a Sceptic, and that he
must have had the work of a Sceptic before him, and that the style of
the scepticism displayed points to Philo.

L. Reinhardt⁸ thinks ἐξ 1-18 Cicero's own ; ἓξ 19-22 from Dicae·
archus3 §23-38 Cicero's own; §539-52 from Posidonius, but §41
from Dicaearchus ς ἓ53-77 Cicero's own; §578-81 of uncertain source 3
§lia-119 Cicero's own.

Kiihner⁴ holds almost the whole of the Tusculan Disputations‚ and
Cicero’s works on ethics generally, to be derived from Stoic sources
But he thinks that in §S 26-49 some views derived from other systems
are intermixed with Stoic material, and that in ἕξ 50-81 Stoic doctrines
are intermixed with material mainly drawn from Plato.

He thinks it clear from ἕξω and 78 that Cicero had the work of
Panaetius before him. For-§3 82-94 he takes Crantor περὶ Πένθους to
be the source ς for ἐξ 97-99 Plato's Apologrb 40 c foll.; for Q 102-108
Chrysippus.

Ο. Heine⁶ thinks it certain that a Stoic work is the source for
§ab-81. He rightly finds little trace of scepticism, while the argu-
ments throughout have a Stoic colouring. He notices the argument
from the consensus gentium as specially valued by the Stoics, and
the doctrine that the soul consists of the finest particles and there·
sore ascends at death to the aether, which is similar in nature, as
purely Stoic. lle notes the Stoic view of the three powers of the
soul (natura, sensus, ratio) (S 56) as found also in De Natura Deorum
ii 12, 33 where it is probably to be referred to Posidonius. Now
Posidonius was a Stoic who blended Platonic with Stoic views, so
that he attributed to the soul pre-existence and immortality, and
abandoning the view of previous Stoics, separated the seat of the
