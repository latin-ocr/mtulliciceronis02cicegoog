of wailing for the dead serves to shew that the dead are believed to be

conscious of their loss, 5 30. (c) The best men work and care for
posterity, 55 31-35.

ll. Philosophic theory also supports the doctrine of immortality.

If the soul exists aster death, the question naturally arises where
does it reside and what is it like? 5 36. The same question arose out
of the question whether death is an evil or not,518. Various views
have been set forth in 55 18-24, the conclusion led up to there being
that whether the soul exist after death, or not, death is no evil. Here
in 5536-52 the point to be proved is that the soul is immortal, and
various views of philosophers as to what the soul is and where it resides
are touched upon or set sorth as leading up to that conclusion.

The idea of the inferiis merely an unphilosophic deduction from ·

the fact that the body falls to the ground and is buried under the
ground, 536. The unphilosophic multitude cannot think of the soul
as apart from the body, 5 37. This idea was first grasped by philosophers,
538·

Pherecydes seems to be the first recorded to have asserted the
doctrine: his pupil Pythagoras established it, Plato gave reasons
for it, 55 38-9. The soul when separated from the body goes alost
and rises to a point where a fiery compound is formed by the blending
of the rarer air with the modified heat of the sun, 55 40-49.

Those who deny the immortality of the soul do so because they are
unable to conceive os or imagine the soul apart from the body. There
is no difficulty in doing this unless we are unable to imagine anything
that we have never seen. The difficulty is rather to imagine the soul
in the body. 5550-52.

lt is not, however, necessary to the establishment of the doctrine
of the immortality of the soul that we should form a mental conception

of the soul or an opinion (5 53) as to where it is situated3 but Cicero
returns to these points in 55 67 and 70.

Argumentslor the immortality of the soul :—

1. That which is sels-moving never had a beginning and will
never have an end3 the soul ‘is sels-moving and therefore immortal.
§bra-55· · '

2. Several arguments not very clearly distinguished or expressed,
55 56-71, see Excursus H on 1 24, 56 foll.

(α) The argument from the indivisible and simple nature
os the soul. This argument is begun in nam sanguinem, bilem...,
5 56, but lost sight of there owing to another argument presenting itself
to Cicero's mind, and ultimately stated in 5 71—that which has no
component parts cannot be broken up.
