cannot be said oi νοῦς, which has no connexion with the body. (See de An. ii ο,

413 b 24 in Zeller p. 568 note a.)

The germ of the soul oi plants is in the seed. With regard to living beings in
which the sexes are distinct Aristotle's view is given in Gen. An. ii 3, 736 6 28. The
germ of the ψυχή belongs to the male, that of the body to the female. (See citations
from Gen. An. in Zeller p. 525 notes 3 and 4.) Itis the animal warmth which makes
γόνιμα εἶναιτὰ σώματα. The more animal warmth the more perfect is the soul,
R. and P. ξ 333. The germ of that portion of the soul which is χωριστὸν σώματος
and the germ of that portion which is ἀχώριστον are both generated together (see
Gen. Anii 3 referred to above), yet Aristotle says in the same place λείπεται δὲ τὸν
νοῦν μόνον θύραθεν ἐπεισιέναι καὶ θεῖον εἶναι μόνον. Hence scholars like Trendelenburg
(on de An. iri 5, ο p. 496) have asserted that ‘ita mens sola diuinitus in fetum intrat,’
and R. and P. make a similar statement, ἕ 337 noted, and Kampe (in Zeller p. 569
n. 3) claims for νοῦς a substratum consisting of αἰθήρ.

Yet, if the opinions of these scholars can be inferred from Aristotle's statements,
they are nevertheless in conflict with principles which are an integral art of
Aristotle’s system. Ι think it more correct to say that Aristotle has left di culties
unsolved or untouched rather than that he has made conflicting statements. Aristotle
has himself (Gen. An. ii 3, 7366 5 quoted in Zeller p. 595 n. 3), as pointed out
by Brentano, only professed to deal rard δύναμιν,..καὶ καθόσον ἐνδέχεται with these
questhilldsrfgdgedEnskdeikse ihbsdifficulties which beset the assumption that νοῦς comes,
by the operation ol natural causes, either from the αἰθήρ or from the deity, or is
introduced by the deity by a creative act. For, since the αἰθήρ is incapable of
increase or diminution, and its etemal circular motion can never, without violence,
change into the centripetal or centrifugal rectilinear motion of the four so-calted
elements, how could the νοῦς pass from the αἰθήρ to earth? The same argument
stltttlhtit httttftsfllellty lalelttltlt‘ilirtilberhti?
duced, in each iirstance, by a creative act of the, deity is opposed to Aristotle's
distinct assertion that the deity does not actively interfere in mundane affairs.

Cicero’s knowledge of Aristotle‘s philosophy must have been slight and incomplete
as compared with that of the scholars above mentioned, and he may well have been
misled by many of Aristotle’s statements. Aristotle's treatment of the animal warmth
is especially liable to mislead, and Zeller pp. 483-7 has much difficulty with this
point. ln Gen. An. (referred to above) the animal warmth is placed exactly where the
ψυχή, including the νοῦς, is placed; and it is declared to be ἀνάλογον τῷ τῶν ἄστρων
στοιχείῳ i.e. to the αἰθήρ. lt is true that Aristotle does not assert the animal warmth
to be identical with αἰθήρ but only ἀνάλογον, but even Ritter and Preller do not seem
to have observed the distinction, as they assert in their note on ξ 333 that Aristotle
thinks that the fifth clement is present in living things in the animal warmth.

What Aristotle means by ἀνάλογον may perhaps be inferred from Zeller's remarks
on p. 4²3 and n. 1 there.
