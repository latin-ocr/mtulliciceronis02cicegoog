403 carmina· Lucr. iv 8. The reserere} for ριν ora with this meaning as against
is specially to Ennius' Annales, iu 18 Aen. xi 296 where it means ‘through' or
books. ‘among mouths’ But the immediate

mercedem glottae, ‘glory as a re· context here, referring to posthumous
ward.' Gen. of definition or contents fame, not to life after death, suits the

seems to support Henry's view, suggest·

propriis bonis laudis et gloriae.’
ing a comparison of the poet to a bird of

lammis: Ennius, as 0. L. generally,

used alliteration freely, cf. funera fletu,
uolito uiuos...ur'rum. Hence Bergk’s
emendation here, dacrumis before dcco·
ret, is tempting, but Reid, on Cato M.
20, 73. where the line also occurs, objects
that if Ennius had really used ducruma
the ancient grammarians would have been
certain to mention a form so extra·
ordinary. Lucian Miiller (Phr'lol. XL111
p. 104) also objects that Ennius is a
thorough moderniser‚ and that the form
dacruma is only mentioned from Livius
Andronicus.

The words decoret mc funera stetu
faxit should follow lacrumis if the quo·
tation were complete. But these words
are not in any of the best MSS, and those
Mss that quote them quote them inaccu-
rately. They are not essential to Cicero's

ur se.
puffiw muco per ora utrum: usually
taken to mean ‘I lloat still living on the
lips of men' But Henry, Aeneadae, on
Aen. xii ²35 ‘ille quidem ad superos
quorum se deuouet aris succedet fama
uiuosque per ora feretur’ holds that there,
and here, and in Georgic iii 8-9 ‘temp-

song, but it may refer to the ‘winged
words' by which his farne is to be
spread.

Mr R. M. Heury suggests that Ennius
may have referred to transmigration
although Cic. did uot take the epitaph in
that sense. He compares Hor. Epp. ii

sed ‚quid poetam sc. commemoro.
For the ellipsis cf. ii17, 41 ‘sed quid
hos...? gladiatores....’ More usually
the verb is expressed‚ Or. 31, 109 ‘sed
{gliriff‘g‘tffl‘ff‘ss} libitu nise·
reading sed quidputas, though supported
by GRB and many inferior MSS and by
Bentley, is obviously wrong.

opifices: the word is somewhat dis·
paraging‚ cf. v 12, 34 ‘Zeno...ignobilis
uerborum opifex ' ; Off. i4a, 150 ‘opifices
omnes in sordida arte uersantur’3 Ac. ii
47, 144 and Reid’s note; N.D. i 8, 18
and Mayor's note.

It seems strange to us to find Phidias
so referred to. For the Roman altitude
towards art and Cicero's own taste in art

tanda uia est qua me quoque possim see Sandys on Or. a, 5 ‘nec solum ab
tollere humo uictorque uirum uolitare per optimis studiis excellentes uiri deterriti
ora‚’ the meaning is ‘before the faces of non sunt, sed ne opifices quidem se ab
men.’ Henry cites Livy ii 383 Sall. Iug. artibus suis remouerunt,‘ where among
