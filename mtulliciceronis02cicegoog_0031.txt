harmony with what we know of the views held by Posidonius. See
explanatory note there. The criticisms of Stoic extreme views con-
tained in Book ii of the Tusculans seem also possible to Posidonius,
while it is difficult to think os any other philosopher who could have
been at once the author os these criticisms and ol the Stoic utterances
cited above.

Much of the argument employed in Book 1 to shew that death is to
be despised also serves to prove that pain is to be endured. Cicero
having in consequence less material available sor Book 11, uses more
padding here than in Book 1. Thus the introduction ἐξ 1-13 is longer.
He quotes frequently from Latin poets and translates at considerable
length from Greek poets. He indulges in 5 35 in fallacious criticism of

the Greek language, de suo. He illustrates from the XII Tables, and
introduces several Roman examples.

All mss of the Tusculan Disputations are descended from an arche·
type which cannot have been later than the 6th or yth century Am, and
may have been much earlier.

From this archetype two groups os mss are derived: group α com·
prising all the best uss now extant along with others os less value 3
group sscomprising the source os the lost Ms from which the bulk ol
the corrections in V, as well as several Mss of the second and third class,
are derived.

Besides these two groups there are several MSS, including O r-6 10
12 which have been copied from mss that had, by correction or eclectio
compilation, received readings from both groups.

The archetype os group α was an uncial Ms belonging probably to
the 7th or perhaps to the 6th century Am. The errors presented by the
uss of this group have to a large extent arisen from the misreading
os symbols and contractions ; there was less fixity with regard to the
use os these in the 6th and yth centuries than at a later date, while
earlier they were much more sparingly used.

The archetype os group β was probably not much earlier than that
of group a. V² presents a remarkable number os readings which are
