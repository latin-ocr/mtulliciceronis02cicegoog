passions and desires from that os the reason. Heine therefore con·
cludes' that he was well fitted to supply the material sor all this part
(ἐξ 26-81) including the arguments drawn from the Phaedo, Phaedrus
and Meno, which he finds¹ so interwoven with Stoic views and

expressions that they can hardly, as he thinks, be taken directly from
Plato. In the second part of the book (ἓξ 82-117) the numerous
passages which are common to the Tusculau Disputations and Plutarch's
Consolatio ad Apollonium shew that these two works must have had a
common source, and Plutarch expressly refers in four places to Crantor’s
περὶ Πένθους as his source. Cicero was santiliar with this work of
Crantor and drew from it' material lor his own Consolatio. The coinci-
dences are set forth in detail by 0. Heine⁹, §91 natura si se sic
habat at quo modo antliam...‚ with Plut c. 153 §92 habes somnum
imaginem mortis with Plut. c. 1²3 §93 ante tompus mori miserum with
Plut. cc. 18, 23, 24, 28 ; ἕ 94 apud Hypanim fluuium...bestiolas with
Plut. c. 17. Both works also contain the stories of Cleobis and Biton,
Trophonius and Agamedes, Silenus Midas, and the Terinean Elysius.
I may add that Plut. also notices the death ol Theramenes, p. 105 b.

The quotation from Callimachus Tusa Disp. i §93 is given in
Plutarch without mention of Callimachus (c. 24) μεῖον γὰρ ὄντως Τρωίλος
ἐδάκρυσεν ἢ Πρίαμος. Heine thinks that Crantor (who was dead by
²70 ne.) can scarcely have quoted Callimachus (who died about 240 nc).
He thinks that Cicero and Plutarch hada later source in common. The
epigram ol Callimachus upon Cleombrotus quoted by Cic. 1 5 84, is
not in Plutarch, but Heine thinks that it was probably in their common
source. Corssen³ thought that Posidonius was the source for all the
matter contained in the first book of the Tusculan Disputations. In
that case Cicero might have found Callimachus’ epigram in Posidonius.
But Heine seems right in finding it improbable that Posidonius should
have copied a work so well known and so widely read in his day as
that ol Crantor, and in laying stress on the lact that Plutarch always
refers to Crantor, and not to Posidonius, as his source.

To take book 1 in greater detail :-

§5 1-8, introductory, are admitted to be Cicero's own.

ἓξ 9-17 Kiihner seems to refer to the same source as ἓξ 82 loll,
ie. to Crantor, since the argument is the same. Heine noteS, inter aloia,
that Crantor employed this argument (that the dead are not unhappy
since they have not any consciousness nor even any existence), comparing
Taso. Disp. i §87 loll. with Plut. Cons. ad Apoll. c. 15, but says that
Cicero's argument is specially Epicurean and thinks Cicero's treatment
