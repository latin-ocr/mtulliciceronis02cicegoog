xviii INTRODUCTION

was fortified by the first book of the Tusculan Disputations (de con-
temnenda morte), i.e. that he learnt from Cicero himself that, if the
worst came to the worst, death was to be despised This remark
could be made only when the occasion for making it arose, whether
the b'ook had been recently received or long before.

4. (a) ln Dc Diu. i 5, 8 Quintus says perlegi tuum paullo aale
tertium de notura deorum.

(b) In De Diu. ii 9, 22 Caesar is referred to as dead.

(c) In De Dia. ii 2, 7 Cicero uses the expression nunc, quoniam
de republica consuli coepti samus.

(d) The De Folo was written after the death of Caesar, and
probably not long after that event, cf. ᾗ 2 above. It probably followed
immediately upon the De Divinatione, cf. 5 2.

(e) On the 11th May, 44 ne, Cicero writes legendus milri saepias
est Calo Maior ad le oriisus¹.

(f) On the 3rd July Cicero promises to send the De Gloria
to Atticus, and he sends it on the 11th⁹.

(g) The Laelius was written before the De Officiis³.

(lo) The first two books De Officiis were written by the 5th
Nov. 44 ne.⁴

It is to be noted that the reference to Caesar as dead and the
expression nunc, quoniam de r. p. consuli coepti sanius both occur in
the second book Do Dtaiaalioae. That book was, therefore, written
after the death of Caesar. The words de r. p. consuli coepti sumas
would seem to fit the few weeks that followed the death of Caesar,
15th March to 11th April, 44 (the senate being prorogued on the latter
date).

Cicero was in or near Rome during those weeks and could attend
the senate, and for a time he had expectations of a return to consti-
tutional govemment. They would not apply to a later date as he
was presentlyundeceived and writes to Atticus the words referred to
in ᾖ 3 above, with reference to the danger of speaking freely.

l cannot see how the words in question could point to the end
of September or beginning of October, 44, as they are taken to do by
Prof. Reid in an obiter dictam in his ,introduction to the Calo Maior,
p. 9 note, for, besides other considerations, the De Gloria was sent to
Atticus on the 11th July, and as it is not mentioned in the De
Dtaiaalione ii 1, 2-4 it is reasonable to infer that it had not been
‘ written when that work was published.

Ι take the second book De Divinatione to have been written very soon
