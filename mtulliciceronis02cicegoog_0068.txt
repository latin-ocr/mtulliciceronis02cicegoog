G in 1143, 66, apellari V G 11 7 (but in the rarer words adprobant 11 8
and adpetentcssemi 11 58, assimilation has not taken place); arripuerit

1 110, arripe 11 20; attulit 1 58, but VP adtulisse1 39. Cf. Fleckeisen,
Frinfoig Artikeln, p. 173 Brambach, Jtseugesraltaeg der lala'nisclteu
Orthograplcie pp. 296-9.

Comm·‚ comp· are the regular 1011115, 01 commotus 1 7, commemini
1 13, coucmentemurl 7 53 complectil 51, comparat 11 2 RVBSEL
(conparat GP), comprimit 11 5 3, conl· more rarely coll, cf. conloquio
1101 VG, conlocet 11 39, conlocari 11 64, but colligit 1 58: conr, cf.
conroboretGin1141. Cf. Fleckeisen, pp. 17, 18 3 Brambach, pp. 300-
300.

The prefix ee· is preserved in eoirant1 41, ecferendi 1 43, ecferitatem
11 20. Cf. Fleck. p. 20; Neue Formenlehre 11 766 1011.

Where ex· is prefixed to a word beginning with s the mss usually

retains, eg. exstet1 37. Cf. Fleck. p. 383 Bramb. pp. 278-280.

In· is seldom assimilated. Cf. tubulusl 14, iubea'llilaleu 15 3 inpulsa
1 53, inparatus 1 86, inponam 1 95 (11111 imperabit 11 51, imperatori 11 62);
inlacrima 1 21, inrisi 11 3, inruebant 11 59. Cf. Fleck. p. 183 Brambach,
PP· 299-302·

The spelling 01 compounds 01 iacio with ii, where the original a has
sunk to i, seems to be supported by the variants in 11 56 elici 101 eici and
11 27 ducantur and dieantur for eiciuntur, but in 11 67 eice is read by
RVGBPEL. See explanatory note on 11 ξ 56.

With the uss and most editors Ι have retained the forms obisset
1 32, obisset 1 86, audisset 1 102, but Ι think they may be due to
haplography.

’ 1111461 have retained the contracted comprendimus, but 1 suspect
this form to be due to compluendimus.

Accusatives plural in -is from i· stems are usual. The rules given
in Fleckeisen, p. 13, generally apply.

In many instances the best 1155 present the superlative in umus, but
there are many others in which they have -imus without any variant.
The two forms seem to have coexisted (01. Bramb. p. 14). The question
is so complicated that in many particular instances it would be difficult
to decide between these forms, especially as I did not take down all
the us evidence on this point from the commencernent 01 my collation.
Ι have therefore thought it better to spell in all cases with imus.
