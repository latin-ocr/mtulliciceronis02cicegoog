xlvi INTRODUCTION

tyrannorum written out of place after ponamus as well as in its proper
place in ἓ 96 after trc'grnta. ,

11 ἓ 5 fere senescat rebus for fenerabas, senescat. §40 in nc'ne, c'n
creantibus uri for in mantibus, nim nri, as Ι believe. §62 esse aeque
grauis esse. Esse was written out of place before aeque and also in its
place after grauis, the first esse being under-dotted and the dots in some
uss being wrongly copied under the second esse. §67 nan wrongly
placed before the first instead of before the second sint. §67 ut uc‘cles
for tu miles. The copyist was probably confused by the u’s preceding
and following (confugiendu tu uides). In 11 ἓ 24 thee of mulciberi was
omitted and then written in the margin. In one group of mss this ε
was re-inserted in its proper place. In the best it was mistaken for a
correction of the first i.

(iii) Jlltsreadc'ng os Symbuls ar Contractians.

r ἓ 3 ccccx for cccccx, the latter not being a usual form. §4graecc'e
misread as graecis. ἓ 24 tempure fomentare, c’p'e for c'p²e; t and care
often confused. ᾗ 31 censeret for nan seret. ca' or ⁹ for na or n the con-
text contributing. 5 41 sc't for ert after quidam. ἓ 42 aculeo} ie. uc‘detur,
was mistaken for ucilea and nc'cleri was inserted to complete the sense.
V has aeder} a great many inferior Mss have uidetur, RGP¹L have

nc'a’eo without uc'a‘em'. §56 esse εῖ probably arose out of etsta, a usual
abbreviation. ᾗ 56 naturam for natura may have arisen from taking
asymbol twice over, ivit] i.e. natura may have been read as natura,
ie. naturam. §57 respondentem seems to have been misread respend-
emem, hence respondem in GR by haplography or, as Ι suspect, by the
overlooking of a symbol of contractiori. §58 quale ειδεαν for qualee'

ψ (least) ιδεαν. The form of theein VP and E13 is very significant.

Similarly in 1 ἓν 5 emari=e' muri i.e. est mari. §62 ιινιίννι9 misread for
anima, a false idea of the construction contributing to deceive the
copyist. §71 direptus for deceptus, ie. dc‘remptus, the symbol having
been overlooked. §7 3 tamquam in rate by ναῖε for rats and ditto-
graphyofprecedingm. Cf.13l. 23‚185 l.2, n 18 l. 16, n 39 l. 12.
There are many cases in which the letter n has been omitted,
eg. §80 nascatur for nascantur3 11 ξ 23 uictumque for uc'nctumque3
11 §53 abuersemr for abuecsentur. The n was probably represented by
a symbol which has been overlooked, a false idea as to the construc-
tion in some instances contributing. Where m is omitted the cause is
probably the same, eg. ιθ 102 nearte for marte i.e. martem3 and perhaps
quamaxumum of 11 §28 was quamaxumum. Conversely n and m are
often wrongly inserted. Here the writer may, in some instances, have
mistaken some stroke for the mark of contractiori, but usually he was
