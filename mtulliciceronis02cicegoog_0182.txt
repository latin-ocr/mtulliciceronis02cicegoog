carere depends upon excutiendum est and
ut sciatur (=ut lroc sciatur 11. quid sir
carere) follows upon excutiendum est quid
111 carere. TS. takes ut sciatur closely
with excutiendum est 111 the sense ο1ο
‘griindlich’— —‘the meaning of the word
carere must be therbugbly examined’

1111111, ‘cause oi 11101,’11. Α111.1148
‘aut aliquis latet error) So' metus often
= ‘cause of fear.'

1111111111 this passage in all Mss follows
the words facile patiare 7 lines lower
down, and merle not mala is readby all
except R6 and (in margin) V6. Orelli
who adopted malo asserts that Bemensis
reads malo, but he was misinformed by
Usteri the Berne professor who supplied
him with the readings of that MS. The
1111 that two early editions (S E) read 11-
rere e'n malo may be taken as probably
shewing that some Renaissance scholar
saw that malo was required. J. M. Brutus
in his edition reads carere enim malo id
11111 dicz'tur, but he does not state the read·
ing of Gr. All emendations hitherto put
forward have been unsatisfactory. Madv.
conjectured and Tr. adopted (probante
Wes.) malo curere in merte3 Keil 11111
carere malo in morte3 Kl. carere malo in
morte3 Η.,511111111,Ρ111“111.1111111416,
ita carere in nrorte, taking ita: ‘in the
second menningo fthe word' as in febri
carere3 R. Enger, carere ea 111111 ui
being supposed to lurk' m eninr), Sil. 11
“ re carere in neerte (11 re and ea ue'
meaning‘ in the latter sense of the word'
just as H. Sauppe‘s ita). But to all these
l object that the context faiis not only to
carry on the argument but even to yield
any definite sense. Bentley confessed
that he did not understandy the words
carere e'n morte.. malum, and 0. Heine

proposed to cut them out, and so obtained
a tolerable sense.

But how then did they come into the
ress? 1 believe that the are merely out

oiplace and that they sbould follow the
words erron's in uerbo. An early copyist
missed this clause beginning with carere
and went on to the clause beginning with
carere igitur boe signficat. When he
had written down to facile patiare he dis·
covered the omission and inserted the
clause beginning with carere in malo, out

of rts proper place. carere 111 malo, not

carere in 1111111, though the latter· rs the
111 reading. A’t some time subsequent
to the error of transposition malo was
altered to morte by an interpolator οι
owing to the act of 1 glossator, who
thought the change demanded by the
words sed ne uiuus quidem and 11111
11111111, following. See Argument ο1
Bk I, Introd. ξ 4, where the line of
thought is worked out and a translation
with some explanatory notes added.

With regard to the ress it need not
excite surprise that a sentence should
have got out of its proper place m all
Mss. Cf. the remarks upon ‘Transposi-
tion,’ Introd.§ 3cii.
