been too familiar with the Greek lan-
guage and also with this story to commit
such a blunder‚ and, as Bent. observed‚
he ,had also Tiro, skilled in both tongues,
to revise for him. Bent. at first con-
jectured prandete ait o sortes Lacedae·
urenti, and Kuh. notes that if he could
approve of any emendatIon he would
simply read prandete Lacedaemonii. But
Bentley found further inconsistencies and
(nolae ineditae p. 23 published at the
end of Davies’ edn. of 1805) decided
that the whole passage quid illc. ..urgebant
was falsely inserted. The clause suit
haec gem fhrtrk...uigebant interrupts the
construction as c quibus untes would
refer, and awkwardly refer, to hacc gans,
whereas it ought to refer to those who
fell at Thermopylae; and though this
objection might be removed by placing
this clause after pugnabimus its presence
would make the transition to uiros com·
memoro less clear and the statement is
inconsistent with ii ¹4· 34 ‘Spartae uero
pueri ad aram...' a passage which shews
that the institutions of Lycurgus retained
much vigour in Cicero's day; see also

Perses: Cic. only used the nom. of
this word here and in Rep. i 27, 43
‘Cyrus ille Perses’ ; in Diu. i 46, 103
Persa is the name of a dog. He has

§mk genuum: instances of this
word, as applied to females, are not rare
in post-Aug. Latin3 a Ciceronian ex-
ample is N .D. ii ar, ¹²9 ‘pisces ut aiunt,
oua cum genuerunt, relmquunt.’

mortem...0ocumbore: most and best
mss read morte, as do many early editions.
But Tischer (in App. to TS.) follows
Wes. in doubting the genuineness of the
reading here ‘as the abl. morte with
occumbere without accompanyr'ng adjective .
only occurs here and in LIvyi 7, 7, aud
the letter m is often omitted even iu the
best uss of the Tusc. Disp' Lamb.
read retorti, but this constr. is only poetic.
In occumbere ntortem the acc. is an ex·
tension of the cognate accus=occumbere
casum mortalem.

[l believe occumbere to bc a gloss,
which has driven out the proper word
oppetere. Iu the only other passage where
occumbere is found in CIceronIan texts,
An. iii 15, 4, it is due to mere cou-
jecture-the secoudhand in Med.]

XLIII. est0=concedo‚ ie. ‘that may
be‚’ but these were a people specially
trained to hardship. Cic. anticipates a
possible objecti0n‚ which he proceeds to
meet by taking instances to'thch no such
objection can apply.
