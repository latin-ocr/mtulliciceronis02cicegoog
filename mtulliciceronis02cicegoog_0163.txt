apart from certain cum-clauses, for which dently before his mind the passage in
seeDraeger, linusque 11 §498 p. 544, Phaedo 85d ‘dciv γὰρ περὶ αύτὰ...ἣ...
ra, and certain other cum-clauses treated ἣ εἱ ταῦτα ἀδύνατον τὸν γοῦν βέλτιστον
ofby Dr. in sub-sections b and c, which τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων λύγων λαβόντα καὶ
seem to admit of another explanation, ὃυοεξελεγκτύτατον, ἐπὶ τούτου ὀχούμενον,
there seems no proof that Cic. used the ὥσπερ ἐπὶ σχεδίας κινδυνεύοντα διαπλεύ-
iterative suhj.. and we are not justified in οαι τὸν βίον)

thrusting the use upon him byemenda- uss here have οναινο. Many editors
tion. The same obJeetion applies to have altered this to ratio to represent
Deiter‘s conjecture qui tam am'ter in λύγος, but λύγος denotes not only ratio

Philologus xuvr p. 176. but οναιῖο. Kiih. therefore follows Mo.

This passage is taken pretty closely
from Phaedo p. 99d ‘uh πάθοιμι ὅπερ ot
τὸν ἥλιον ἐκλείποντα θεωροῦντες καὶ
σκοπούμενοι· διαφθείρονται γάρ που ἔνιοι
τὰ ὄμματα, ἐὰν μὴ ἐν ὕδατι ἥτινι τοιούτῳ
σκοπῶνται τὴν εἰκόνα edroi)

[The ut-clause has all the appearance
of being genuine, and an explanation of
quod. quicumque may be the right
reading]

aspectum: cf. v 38, ιιι ‘etiam si
non adhibeatur aspectus'3 v 39, ¹14
‘inpediri...animi aciem aspectu ocu·
lorum)

se fusa intuens: see 23, 54 n. We.
should have expected ipsam here, as the
contrast is to solem intuens, but the Ms
authority is more in favour of ipsa, and
the nom. is more emphatic. So often,
cf. p. Sulla 13, 39 ‘de se ipse confessus
esset.'

eummspautanu: this word often im-
plies anxiety, cf. Tac. Agr. 32 ‘mare et
siluas, ignota omnia circumspectantes)

multa aduersa reuersus: reuerens
seems a necessary corr. for reuertens of
most Mss. reucrens is rare in Cic. in
the sense of ‘ dreading,’ but cf. Or. ii 28,
ιιι ‘dicam enim non reuerens adsen-
tandi suspicionem'

umquam ratis tn man tumeam
nustm uenttur ontio: Cic. has evi·

in taking Cic. to have understood λύγοι
as :oratio personified.

l have adopted su’s reading tamquam
ratis, a reading found in Vi and 091,
for which there is much to be salci,
whether we alter to ratio with him or
retain oratio as explained by Mo. and
Kuh.; ‘our utterance is borne along
like some skiff upon a boundless sea.
There seems no fitness in our ‘utterauce’
or our ‘theory’ being in a skiff and (a
point not put forward by sff.) it is not so
m the Platonic passage, but weourselvas
are embarked upon the λόγος as upon
a raft. sff. explains the in of the best
Mss by dittography after the m of tam·
quam and rate as corrupted from rata* =
ratis. It is a point in favour of ratio
that we could embark on aplan better
than on an oratio.

As oratio can be explained it may be
retained, but Sff. remarks ‘Oratio et
ratio inter se permixta sunt in G et R
praeter hunc locum i 112, 116, iii 76,
v 47,' and Kiih. gives other instances.
Strongly in favour of the readings ratis'
ancl οναιίο here are iv 5, 9 ‘utrum pan·
derem uela orationis’ and iv 14, 33
‘quoniam tamquam ex scrupulosis co·
tibus enauigauit orati0,' in which passages
the oratio sails like a ratis.
