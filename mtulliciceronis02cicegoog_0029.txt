have been adopted by Posidonius also. ἓ 66. This extract inserted
from the Consolatio gives the substance of the argument of the pre-
ceding sections. Was this extract derived from Crantor, and if so
whence were the preceding sections derived? Rather Ι think that this
and the preceding sections and the arguments put forward in the
Consolatio for the immortality of the soul were derived from Posidonius, ’
for we know that he held this doctrine and we do not know that it was
held by Crantor. §568-70. Here we have Stoic teleology. §71 con-
tinues the argument begun in ἕ 56 (see explanatory notes). ἓξ 72-6 are
derived ultimately from Plato, especially Phaedo pp. 80 foll, but
perhaps directly from Posidonius. §377-81 probably from Posidonius,

the Roman example of P. Crassi nepos, and perhaps that of Afrr'caai .

fratris nepos, being Cicero's own. Compare De Divinatione ii 9, 22
‘clarissimorum hominum nostrae ciuitatis gravissimos exitus in Con-
solatione collegimus!

§§82-97 from Crantor, directly or indirectly, with Roman examples
of his own.

ἕξω-99. This extract from Plato's Apologra may have been used Ι

ϋγῸταῃῑοτ.

§5100-102. The illustrations bere given were probably found by
Cicero in his source.

ἓξ 102-8. These extracts from Chrysippus (cf. permulta alia colligit
Chrysippus> cannot have been used by Crantor who belonged to the
previous generation. Heine thinks it doubtful whether they were taken
from a work of Chrysippus by Cicero himself, or were merely remi-
niscences of lectureS, since some of his examples are found in Sext.
Hyp. iii 226, andin connexion with them the stories of Silenus and of
Cleobis and Biton, and the quotation from Euripides' Cresphontes.

The contrast between the treatment of funeral honours etc. here
and in the first part os the book (ἓξ ²7 foll.) is noteworthy. There
men’s view of the importance of sepulture is made an argument for
immortality. It may have occurred to Cicero that this argument had
to be met in part 11, aud he may have resorted to Chrysippus for
material.

§3109-111 from Crantor, directly or indirectly, with Roman illus-
tratious inserted by Cicero.

ἓξ 113·117 from Crantor directly or indirectly.

ἓξ 112, 118, 119 Cicero's own.
