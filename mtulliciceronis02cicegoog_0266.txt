Dav. quotes Lactant. Diu. Inst. ina
‘Minos se in antrum Iouis recondebat
et, ibi diu moratus, leges tamquam sibi
a Ioue traditas adferebat'; Hom. Odyss.

Plato, Minos pp. 46, 47.

Minos: few now have doubts as to the
reality and power of Minos. For the
latest notice of the discoveries at Cnossus,
which have helped to convince the most
sceptical, see l). G. Hogarth in Quarterly
Revr'ew, No. 400 (Oct. 1904).

adaram: cf. Plutarch Inst. Lacon. p.
²39 d :-once a year at Sparta a flogging
competition (διαμαστίγωσις) was held in
which boys endured the whole day long
to be torn with whips (ξαινόμενοι μάστιξι)
at the altar of Ἄρτεμις Ὀρθία, persisting
in some cases until they died under the
lash. the object ol the contest being to de·
tetmine who should longest and best hold
out. ln Lycurg. ro Plut. says that he
saw thern dying under the lash, and
Lucian in Anacharsis c. 38 says that
statues were set up to those who so died.
The vietor bore the title os βωμονίκας.
ln Boeckh, Cap. Inscr. Graec. 1364 b,
the honours os one Tib. Claudius Sophron
are set sorth, the first mentioned being
that he was liopertum. Tertullian ad
Mart. c. iv says the practice was regularly
maintained in his day (about αοο Ab. j.

The meaning of the custom is very clear
from Philostratus and Pausanias r-Philo·
stratus (Apoll. Tyaneus vi ao) says that
the flogging was in honour of the
Scythian Artemis and that it was said
to have been ordered by oracles; that

institution into a test of endurance which
did not involve death. The pertinacity
os the competitors accounts for the deaths,
which were not, it seems, originally con·
templated.

Pausanias, iii 16, 7, says that earlier a
man chosen by lot was sacrificed in
obedience to an oracle which declared
that the altar ought to be stained with
human blood and that Lycurgus changed
the practice. See also Sext. Empir.
Pyrrh. Hypot. iii 243 and Miiller, Dorrans
1 398 tE.'r.); Seyffert, Dr'ct. Class. Ant.
s.v. Artemis. The practice of offering
human sacrifices to a goddess with the
attributes ol Artemis was very wide-
spread, but, just as in the case os the
worship os Diana at Aricia, this Spartan
worship was sabled to have been trans·
planted from the Tauri. For the human
sacrifices there cf. Enrip. I.T. ad init.
and Frazer's Golden Bouglr, ad init.

As the object of the proceedings was
to cover the altar with blood, all ornearly
all the competitors must have bled, hence
multus rather than mullis gives the
meaning required.

uerbertbus accipiuntur: usually, when
this verb is used of unpleasant things,
there is irony; afficiantur (a reading
weakly supported) is more what we
should expect lrom Cicero ; but Cic. may
here have in view the cheerfulness and
exultation (lhapol rol γαῦροι, Plut. Inst.
Lac. lc.) displayed by the victims.
Moreover the word seems seriously used
in iv 36, 78 ‘quote modo accepissem,
inquit, nisi iratus essem! There is even
room ior a shade oi irony in both
passages.
