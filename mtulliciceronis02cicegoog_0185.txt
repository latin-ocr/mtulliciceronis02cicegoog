sit nihil posse in eo esse, qui ipse non sit, quid potest esse in eo
15 odiosum, qui nec careat nec sentiat? quamquam hoc quidem
nimis saepe, sed eo, quod in hoc inest omnis animi contractio
ex metu mortis. qui enim satis uiderit, id quod est luce clarius,

Sequania. Probably Lucania first occurs
iu Hor. S. ii 1, 38. This raises the
thzlulltll‘hllzet‘tleuitt
for hircanis. W'olfflin does not deal with
Campania, which Cic. seems to avoid,
though Varro used it. As to Lucania cf.
‘subigit omne Loucanom’ in the Scipio
inscription]

Gracchum: cf. Livy xxv cc. 16, 17.

111 hoc: ie. in the fear that men have
feeling and perception after death.

subjunctives all three come under one
head-reported thought ; the clauses in
which they occur are essential to the
sense of the clauses that depend upon
uiderit and perspiciet respectively. Cf.
Madv. θ 369.

hippocentaurum: Cic. takes the cen·
taur asan example in N.D. i 38, 105;
ii 1, 5 ; Diu. ii 11, 49. For a clear and
commonsense proof of the impossibility
of centaurs see Lucr. v. 878 sqq.

regem Agamemnonem: sc. qui reuera

fieerit.

hoc ciuile bellum: not, as Hei. sup·
poses, the fighting between Antony and
the murderers of Caesar ; for Atticus was

Rome at that time aud up to a much

,later date (cf. Art. xv 11 written about

the 11111 June, 44l3 and there was uo
fighting till the actions around Mutina
iu the spring of 43 uc. The civil war
here referred to is that between Caesarand
the Pompeians3 the battle of Munda was
fought on the 17th March.451³.c. ; Cicero
planned the Tusculan Disputations in the
five days following the soth July, 45 B.c.;
he may not have regarded the Civil War
as ended while Sextus Pompey survived,
and as a matter of fact Sextus Pompey
was continuously active; Caesar did not
return to Rome from Spain until Sep·
tember; and the word hoc would not be
inappropriate until a good while after the
war was finished‚ as there was only one
civil war with which 10 contrast it, the
war between Marius and Sulla.

quum ego 1110 uiuo: besides being
better supported by the Mss this order of
words, which brings the pronouns to·
gether, is more Ciceronian than that
found in G R quam ego uiuo ill.

uo1eret...puurer: cf. 11, ²7 note on
haereret. ‘Would have grieved had he
believed,’ both verbs denoting continuing
states of the mind; if this be sodoleum
and putem are subjunctives of pure hypo· ’
