omitted after 'hnowuprepdv in 1 5 84, the copyist being further confused
by the Greek letters In 15 37 in uicta or in uitia for in ut'cinr'a the
copyist overlooked one of the syllables ending in i, and in 115 34 quas
siue Minos he overlooked one of the clauses beginning with siue. In
5 31, ut ait in Synephebis, ille may have fallen out after ar't either because
of the resemblance of il to it of ait, or because of the following in. In
5116 th'e initial co· probably caused commemorant to be omitted after
Codrum.

Conversely the copyist sometimes wrote one or more letters, syllables,
or words, twice over, as in 1569 deorum eorum 3 577 accerrume 3 578
simmam 599 mallt‘m3 5 111 intollerabile3 115 22 intolleranter3 5 42
tollerabilem 3 543 tollerantrr3 15113 statutum sor statum (the latter
word being rare) 3 543 magna animorum 3 546 quoda ta tam 3 5 47 duos
simus 3 11 5 48 unquit iteot3 5 52 Callanus; 561 Poseidonias. Similarly
in 1 5 53 et aeternum3 11 5 72 uolut, ie. ul ¹ ut for uel (αἶ’). Similarly we
have 1576 ulla uti rotrone ut, utbeing a duplication of uti due to the
fact that that word was misunderstood, and in 115 58, but only in a few
inferior MSS, uel si sentiunt se for uel sentiunt sed: si is a duplication of
the following se which seemed necessary to the sense when sed was read
as se. 1 588 uec carere quidem (the idiom nec=ne...quidem contributing)3
5 97 uadit enim in (VADITNIN) for uadit in3 5118 plone in nostram
for plane nostram, in being in the preceding context and an idea as to
the construction contributing; 1 5 73 tamquam in rate for tamquam ratis 3
11 5 10 quodam abductus for quodam ductus.

(c) ddtitakt'rog one letter far another.

u for a.

Similarly iu 5 5² ato was misread as uo.

α for u.

1520 normam (after finxit) for anamum3 529 (very possibly) tra-
dantur for traduntur 3 580 dicamur (after naec) for dicuntur 3 (dicantur
for dicatur, two lines lower down, may have contributed) 3 fan'aut for
sariunt: 15 91 animam for am'mum.
