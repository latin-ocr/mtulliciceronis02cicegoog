the case of similar rejoicings with regard
to himself on his return from exile, cf. in

fortunatum, ‘a piece of luck’3 an
instance of good fortune for Pompey, cf.
‘miserum’ 5, 9.

Cic. is dealing only with misfortunes
that befell Pompey personally; and that
his property might have been seized by
others at the time when it was seized,
even though he had died much earlier.
deleti, though supported by several
editors, seems irreconcilable with the
fact that one son was alive when Cic.
wrote this passage. Mo. says ‘quasi
dixerit paene deleti’: this would be the
rhetorical use of the plural. And even
though deleti were justified the other
objections quoted above from Hei. would
still apply. Of these Reiske's conj.,
essent deleti, approved by Wesenberg,
only removes one, and Baiter's expulsion
of non liberi defleti only removes two,
while the marginal gloss theory. which
would account for the presence of these
words, can also account for all down to

possiderentur. sff. gets rid of some

objections by taking defleti not as=de·

fleti essent but as a participle=deplorati
