the best. In 11 50 it reads pudens and in 1160 qaam carn with some
os the best and in 11 20 latare with the best. In 1 48 it has leto nubila,
with BS¹ and others, against the best, and in'11 39 continuatur with a few

permanantibus with V² alone3 in 1 88 carere enim in malo with V 6 marg.
alone3 in 1 112 aueo withOa alone3 in 112 liberemur with L4 alone3
