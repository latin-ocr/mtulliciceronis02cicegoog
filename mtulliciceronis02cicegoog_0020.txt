INTRODUCTION xv

dispelled the last hope from the directiou of the Pompeians. Domestic
troubles increased3 in the end of 47, or early in 46, he had divorced
Terentia, to whom he had been married for about thirty years, and
his marriage with Publilia in December, 46, brought him nothing but
disappointment. These circumstances contributed to render the con-
solations of philosophy necessary to Cicero. But the event that
decisively influeuced the course of his studies was the death of his
daughter Tullia in February, 45 ac, From that time onward his
philosophie writings, with the single exception of the Topica, a slight
work written in the summer of 44 ae, deal with ethics and theology.
And he wrote very little besides. The epistula ad Caesarem de
ordinanda republica was indeed written, though never delivered. The
prOJected πολιτικὸς σύλλογος, more Dicaearchi, was never worked out.
The death of Tullia plunged her father into unutterable grief.

Fleeing from the Tusculan villa, where the sad event occurred, he
shut himself up for some three weeks in the house of Atticus in
Rome. From thence he moved to Astura, where he arrived on the
7th of March. There spending his days in the woods adjacent to his
villa he sought relief in uninterrupted work¹, and between the 7th and
15th of March³, 45 B.c., he wrote the Consolatio or de Lueta Mtauendo.

On the 16th we find him making inquiries from Atticus with a view to
writing the Hortensius. This work served as an introduction tothe
series of philosophical writings now projected by him, the Consolatio
having been directed to the particular end of mitigating his own grief.
The Hortensius was finished in the middle of April, 45 uc. Next,
between that time and the 13th of May, the two-book edition of the
Academica (“Catulus” and “Lucullus'') was written⁴. The first book
of the De lintius had been sent to Atticus for publication hythe
aoth May, and the edition of the Academica in two books earlier than
that date⁶. The recasting of the Academica iu four books was made
in the end of June, and the books were actually delivered to Varro on
the 19th or zoth July. By the end of June the last four books De
Finibus were complerent After the completion of the four-book

edition of the Academica and of the De lintius, Cicero wrote the
Tusculan Disputatious⁷.
