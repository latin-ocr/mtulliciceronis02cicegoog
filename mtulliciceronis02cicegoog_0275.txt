habituation. Military training is a good
kind of preparation. Eurypylus illus·
trates the effect of this training. He is
in no hurry to have his wound dressed,
and Patroclus, assuming or knowing him
to be a despiser of pain, asks him ques·
tions about the fortune of the army in-
stead of binding his wound at once.
quiesce igitur is best referred to Cicero,

- who, assuming the mental attitude of a
spectator sympathising with the wounded
man, wishes Patroclus to bind the wound
at once. It is addressed to Patroclus as
in the immediate context surprise was ex·
pressed that P. should not attend to the
wound without delay. To refer the
words to Eurypylus would, besides giv-
ing a doubtful metrical form of words,
be open to the objection that it would
rather detract from the fortitude dis·
played by Eur. instead of helping for·
ward the argument.

(3) Whether do the words etiamsi

thinks, or to explicare in dolore following,
as Ktth. supposes, or to ecfari tantum

Or. and Mo. take thern to do? The first
view is favoured only by the position of

seems to take this view.

With all explanations however the
passage is unsatisfactory and emenda·
tion seems necessary. Schtttu suspected
that the clause etiam si Eurypylus...
Aesopus should come before the clause
quiesce...alltga. Perhaps some words
have fallen out after Aesopus. In any
case the line ubi fortuna... is introduced
very abruptly.
