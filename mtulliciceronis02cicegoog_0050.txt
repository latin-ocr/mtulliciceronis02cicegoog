(c) Analysis of MS errors.

The ms authority for the text of the Tusculan Disputations is
decidedly good. In the books contained in the present edition there
is no corrupt passage that does not admit of a satisfactory emendation
such that the existing ms readings can be explained upon principles
generally recognised, and very often where the best mss are in error the
true reading is found in one or more of the later mss Τ he errors of the
principa} mss may be classified under the following heads :—-

(i) Glosses.

153 qui fuit nautor natu quam Plautus et Naeuius. 57 operam
before dedzmm. 522 elie· after et tam multe. 552 sit leoc seipsum
posse cognoscere, sit being no doubt acopyist's error for sc. = scilieet, and

the clause perhaps containing a gloss upon a gloss, as suggested in the
explanatory notes. 5 54 semper before moueat, brought in from 5 5 3.
565 froc before expressimus. 576 ut after ratione. 577 contemnit.
586 non liberi defleti, non somenae omnes e nemoribus possiderentur.
5 101 quid ille dux...utgebont.

11 5 30 dum after gloriantem. Ι take dum to have arisen from dm =
de'centem placed in the margin to explain the construction, and subse-
quently copied into the text. ln V dumis over an erasure. V¹ may
have had dm. 536 In seurota, the reading of R, I think thats must
have come from the margin, where I take it to have been placed to come
at the end of the word eurota. 5 55 fletus for lessus.

(ii) Transpositzons.

1537 imagines maurinorum for mortuorum imagines. These words
would be very weak as a remark os Cicero, and they are hardly a gloss, ’
for they add to the lucidity of the passage, their presence being almost
implied in lias terren inregines. 5 67 fortasse quamquam for quamquam
fortasse. 588 cerere in malo non limitum nec enim esset dolendum·
di'cilur illud: bono carere, quod est malum wrongly placed in the mss
after facile petiere instead of before carere igitur hoc significat, if my
conjecture is correct. 594 euim for ita aut with the loss of a letter,
and 5113Binofo for Biton with the addition of a letter. 595 iussu
