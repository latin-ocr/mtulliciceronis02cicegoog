sine causa Apollini dicati sint, sed quod abeo diuinationem
habere uideantur, qua prouidentes quid in morte boni sit curn
cantu et uoluptate moriantur, sic omnibus bonis et doctis esse Α

cumcantu moriantur: cf. Plato, Phaedo wise we should have amittant not
84 e, 85 b ‘uei ὡς ἔοικε, τῶν κύκνων auritterent. Or. holds that the expres·
δοκῶ φαυλότερος ὑμῖν εἶναι τὴν μαντικόν, sion usu uenit arose from usus uenit,

ol ἐπειδὰν αἴσθωνται ότι όεῖ αὐτοὺς ἀπο-
θανεῖν, ᾄδοντες καὶ ἐν τῷ πρόσθεν χρόνῳ,,
τότε δὴ πλεῖστα καῖ μάλιστα ᾄδουσι,
γεγηθότες ότι μέλλουσι παρὰ τόν θεὸν
ἀπιέναι οὗπερ εἰσὶ θεράποντες ...... τοῦ
’Λπόλλωνος ὄντες μαντικοό τέ εἱσι nal
προειδότες τὰ ἐν ’Άιδου ἀγαθὰ ᾅδουσι καὶ
τέρπονται ἐκείνην τὴν ἡμέραν διαφερόντως
ἢ τῷ ἔμπροσθεν χρόνῳ.’ The opinion
widely prevalent among the aucients‚
that the dying swan sings, is denied by
Pliny, H. N. x 23 ‘olorum in morte
narratur flebilis cantio: falso, ut arbitror
aliquot experimentis) See also Sir T.
Browne, Vulgar Errors 111 ιγ. The

theory, with numerous connected points, '

is well discussed by Geddes in an ex·
cursus to Phaedo, as above, note Ο.

ut cygni...: we have here an anaco-
louthon, the interposition of the explana·
tory clauses sed quod...boni sit having
caused the thread of the construction to
be lost as in 17, 40 ‘num igitur dubita·
mus...terram'; 36, 88 ‘confirmato illo‚'
where see notes. cygni is nom. to
moriantur and instead of qua proui-
denter we should strictly have had qua
prouideant. Davies' conj. quasi for qua
is impossible? since prouidenter does not
involve a metaphor requiring modifica·
tion or apology. Moreover there is not
any similar qualification in the Greek,
quoted above. Reiske and others supply
faciunt( aciani) to cygni from the fol·
lowing acz'endum.

usu uenit: uenit is here perfect, other·

common in old Latin, and that, the final
ς being almost silent in pronunciation‚
usu' came to be regarded asan abl..
usu uenit being = casu accidit3 Otto on
the other hand thinks usu was in origin
the contracted dative usui and that usu
uenit = ειςιιί se offert (obtulit).

qur cum aedter...tntuerentur, at...=
if we read as in the text with almost all
Mss including the best, we have an
anacolouthon, as we should strictly have
had quadris saepe usu uenit qui acriter...
intuiti surtt, ut aspectum onmino atrrr't·
terem, or quod eis saepe usu mni! qui
crena..intuerentur, aspectum omnino anti·
serunt. The subj. intuerentur follows
cum temporal because the order of
succession in time is also in this case an
order of cause and effect, cf. Madv.
θ 358. Schiche substitutes uel for ut.
lf uel were read or ut were absent
before aspectum we should have no
anacolouthon. ut is said to be absent
from two inferior Mss and might be
thought to have come in by dittography
after ·ur‚ but we should expect amiserunt
not amitterent if ut were absent, and Mo.
is probably right in supposing that the
omission is due to a corrector.

cum before acriter is absent from at
least one inferior lus and omitted from
several early editions. cum is bracketed
by Bai. and TS. and by Klotz, following
Madv. Wes. Hei. If this were accepted
it would seem impossible to explain the
subj.intueremurexceptasiterative. But,
