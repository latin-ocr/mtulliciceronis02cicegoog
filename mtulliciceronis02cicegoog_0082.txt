curate. Strictly it should be ‘haec enim
ratio eontra alterius opinionem disserendi
uetus et Socratica ratio est.’

marandi: genos contents or defi·
nition; cf. Madv. 5 286, Roby513023 also
called genetiuus appositionalis Draeger
1§ nor. Cf. ‘nomen carendi’ 36, 87 n.

quta nort stmssltmum esset: the New
Academy sought probabilia, not believing
certainty to be attainable. For the ques·
tion whether Socrates believed positive
knowledge attainable and for the opinion
held in Cicero’s day with regard to his
views see Reid on Ae. ii 23, 74.

V. ἕ 9. The initials A. and M. have
given rise to much discussion. Obviously
they must be abbreviatious which the
text is supposed to explain. A. therefore
cannot stand for Atticus, although, ac·
cording to Dav„ codd. Eliens. i and ii
have Atticus, and Lactantius, Diu. Inst.
i 15, refers to Atticus as the person ad·
dressed here. For' Atticus is not any-
where mentioned as present at the dis·
putations, and if 0. E. Schmidt’s careful
and clear reasoning as to the dates of the
several letters be correct it follows that
Atticus must have been in Rome to re·
ceive Att. xiii 44 after the disputations
had commenced. Moreover, as pointed
out by Fr. Fabricius, Atticus, at that
time 65 years old, could not be the
adulescens of ii ro, 28. Many, induced
by the passage last referred to‚have taken
A. to mean adulescens and M. magister,
and these terms have the merit of being
Ciceronian, though magister would apply
rather to the conductor of a ludus than to
the director of a philosophical discussion.

The most ¹obvious explanation is that
which makes A.=Auditor‚ cf. ‘is qui
audire uellet' of the previous ς, and
M. :Marcus, cf. ‘ego’ of the previous §-
But Hei. olrjects to the latter that the
praenomen was only used in intimate
discourse.

The objection however loses its weight
and the discussion most of its importanee
if, as seems certain, these initials form no
part of the original text. They are ab·
sentirem most tiss. In G they do not
occur in Book 1 after reuolueris eodem in
i 6, ιη they are several times o'mitted
within the short space in which they
uceur; and once (at inepte sam) M. stands
by error for A. From iii 7, 9 ‘poposci
eorum aliquem qui aderant causam dis·
serendi,’ it may perhaps be inferred that
A. was not necessarily the same person
throughout the five days’ discussion.

[Some mode bf distinguishing the in·
terlocutors there must have been, and
as the principal is thoroughly identified
with Cicero, see eg. 5, 32, it is hardly
likely he was designated by a general
title such as aragister. About the other
interlocutor there is nothing more in-
dividual than what is found in n§26‚whieh
is not much]

miserum: used here for the sake of
symmetry to balance malum, though not
established as a substantive as bonum and
arolam were. See Kiih., who compares
Fin. v 28, 84 ‘bonum liberi; misera
orbitas. ..bonum ualetudo; miser morbus‚'
etc.

malum=an evil objectively3 miserum
is subjective.
