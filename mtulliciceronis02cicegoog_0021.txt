INTRODUCTION

(b) The date of the Tusculan Deiputotions.

The precise date of composition of the Tusculan Disputations cannot
be positively determined. The facts which bear upon the solution of
this question are :-

1. several references contained in the work itself;

2. the passage in De Diu. ii r, 2-43

3. two allusions in the letters to Atticus3

4. the dates of composition of most of his subsequently written
philosophical works.

Taking these in detail :—

1. (a) the decessus of Brutus referred to in Ture. Disp. i 4, 7 took
place on the aoth of July‚ 45 ae. Cicero was in his Tusculan villa from
the aoth to the 24th July and left for Astura on the 25th. See the
commentary ad locum. The subjects of the five books of the Tusculan
Disputations are represented to have been discussed on these five days,

’ aoth to 24th July, and the books were no doubt planned during those

days, as Dr Ο. Ε. Schmidt assumes¹.

(b) The fourth book DeFr'nibm is mentioued in Tusc. Disp. v
11, 32 as lately read (queo legi tuum nuper quartum de Jri'rn'bus). That
book was finished, as we have seen above, by the end of June, 45.

The facts which I have just stated in sections (a) and (b) above
suffice to discredit the view of Heine that when on the 28th and 29th of
May he writes to Atticus (Art. xiii 31 and 3²) for certain books of
Dicaearchus, Cicero is collecting material for the Tusculan Dispu-
tations. That work had not then been planned. A thoroughly satis-
factory theory is given by Ο. Ε. Schmidt (Briefw. p. 375). The
materials referred to were wanted by Cicero for the πολιτικὸς σύλ-
λογος more Dicaearchi of Ate. xiii 30, 3.

2. In De Diu. ii 1, 3 Cicero states that the three books De
Nature Deorum were completed (pessero) after the publication of
the five books of the Tusculan Disputations, and he announees his
intention of adding a work De Folo. As he mentions the De Senectute

in ἓ 3, that work was also written before the De Diuinooonet
If we were to take the statement strictly that the Tusculan Dis·

beate uiuendum maxime necessarias aperuerunt... 5 3. quibus editis tres libri
perfecti sunt de natura deorum...quibus, ut est in animo, de fato si adiunxerimus,
erit abunde satis factum toti huic quaestioni....interiectus est etiam nuper liber is
quem ad nostrum Atticum de senectute misimus.''
