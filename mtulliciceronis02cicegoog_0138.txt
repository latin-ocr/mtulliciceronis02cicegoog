na occtdtt qudam, ‘not...either.' For
the reading see 26, 65 n.

neo ex aa: the best uss omit ex, but in
Rep. vi 25 the best Mss read nec ex se
and Plato has οὔτε ἄλλο ἐξ ἐκείνης γενήσε-
ται. ec and ex were so frequently con-
fused that we have here nodoubt a case
of haplography.

motus principium: Plato’s words are
olto δὴ κινήσεως μὲν ἀρχὴ τὸ avlrd αὐτὸ
κινοῦν, ‘the source os motion is a thing
which is sels-moving.' cic. expresses the
same meaning by ‘motion originates from
a thing which is seli-moving.’ principium
here is used in the abstract sense of ‘com-
mencement,’ while iu the previous lines
it has been several times used in the
concrete sense of ‘initial cause' The
seeming contradiction between this line
and principii nulla est origo has led Hei.
to give the words ex eo sit quod a meaning
(⁶belongs to the class of that which’) for
which it would be hard to find parallels.
The instance wh. he quotes from Off. i 30,
107 does not bear that interpretation.

uel eonnuat omne eaelum omnisque
natura mulctat necem est: this, the
reading of the uss, has given rise to
many attempts at emendation. Plato
hasrj πάντα τε οὐρανὸν πᾶσάν τε γένεσιν
συμπεσοῦσαν στῆναι καὶ μήποτε αὖθις ἔχειν
ὅθεν κινηθέντα γενήσεται. TS. and Hei.
retain the rus reading. The meaning then
is ‘or else the whole universe must in-
evitably sink in ruin and all creation
(=created things) come to a standstill.'
This gives very good sense although it is
slightly different from the words of Plato,
who makes the whole universe and all
creation both siuk in ruin and come to a
standstill. For caelum in this sense cf.
N .D. ii 39, 101 ‘ultimus et a domiciliis
nostris altissimus caeli complexus qui

idem aether uocatur, extrema ora et de·
terminatio mundi, in quo cum admira·
bilitate maxima igneae formae cursus
ordinatos definiunt! See also N.D. ii
36, 913 ii 45.117, and L. aud Sc. sv.
οὐρανὸς 1 4. Some editors have stumbled
over uel. If we had here a disjunctive
proposition co·ordinated witha preceding
negative proposition we should expect
aret and not uel. But the clause, just as
the ἦ clause in the corresponding Greek,
is loosely tacked on (cf. Madv. Gk Synt.
R 1 App. 5283.) For aut and uel see
Draeger 11 ἐς 343, 344. The conjecture
terra for natura, approved by Bentley
(‘recte Lambinus aliique ex Platone ipso
omnr'sque terrast), was disposed of when
Bekker restored γένεσιν in Plato, with
the best usa, for γῆν. In order to brin
Cic. into more exact correspondence vul
Plato, K'uh. after Or. inserts ac between
natura and consistat on M'a'hly's con-
jecture. But Reid, on Ac. ii ιι, 34, has
shewn that ac, where it occurs in Mss of
Cicero before a guttural. is to be viewed
with so much suspicion that a conjecture
which inserts ac before a guttural can
scarcely be accepted. Schiche follows
Ml. who, relying on the uss of Rep. vi
25, 27 and Macrobius, inserts et. The
conjectures of Sil, ut non for uel and sit
forest (after necesse), seem unnecessary if
uel be taken as above suggested3 other-
wise the construction given by him is no
doubt correct, and the three changes in·
volved are changeswhich often‚separately‚
occur.

qua a primo: most Mss qua primo,
but several uss of Somnium Scipionis
(Macrobius) give a. Similarly in ii 1, 4
‘auxilia a‚’ iv ar, 47 ‘auersa a ratione‚'
v 25, 70 ‘illa a deo’ good uss omit a
after final a.

a primo = primitus, a principio. Kuh.
