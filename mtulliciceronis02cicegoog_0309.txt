[These remarks are not meant to exhaust the subjects to which they refer but
merely to throw light upon some points which occur in the Tusculan Disputations.]

The deity is immaterial, see Arist. Met. xii (Λ) c. 6, and extracts in Ritter and
Pre1e15322n.

He is outside the universe, Zeller‚ Ph. d. Gr. Ῑι2 p. 364, and note 6, buthe isin
contact with the outer circle of the οὐρανός (ὁ πρῶτος οὐρανός), Zeller p. 356 and note a.

He ishimself motionless‚ Zeller pp. 339 foll.; R. and P. ἓ 323 and notes.

He is the cause of motion to the outer circle of the οὐρανός, the sphere of the fixed
starS, which moves all else, R. and P. ibid.; Zeller pp. 373 foll.; each lower sphere
being in immediate contact with the sphere next above it, Zeller p. 456n. νς and
being moved by that sphere, and each higher sphere being more perfect than the
next below it, in proportion as it is nearer to the first mover, R. and P. ξ 337 n.

This outer circle of the οὐρανός, which is moved by the deity, consists of αἰθήρ,
which is described in de Caelo i 3, quoted in R. and P. ἓ 33ι; see also Zeller
pp This—{lement is without beginning and indestructible, incapable of increase or
diminption, unchangeable, and etemal‚ de Caelo i 3, ayoa 13, b r, quoted in Zeller,

. n. a.
p ⁴lst is πρῶτον στοιχεῖον and τὸ τῶν ἄστρων στοιχεῖον, Zeller p. 437 n. 7.

It is neither light nor heavy, de Caelo i 3. For that which is light moves from
the celntre and that which is heavy moves towards the centra but αἰθήρ moves in
a circ e.

It ls ἡ πρώτη odolo τῶν σωμάτων, τὸ πρῶτον σῶμα, and very different (ἔτερόν τι)
from the four elements‚ earth, air, fire, and water, de Caelo i 3, ayob. It is odola
θειοτέρα καὶ προτέρα τούτων ἁπάντων, cf. Zeller p. 473 n. 7.

The αἰθήρ is material, since it revolves, cf. Met. xiia, 1069b 24 πάντα δ’ ὓλην ἔχει
ὅσα μεταβάλλει,..καὶ τῶν ἀιδίων ὅσα μὴ γεννητά, κινητὰ δὲ φορᾷ, ἀλλ’ οὐ γεννητὴν,
ἀλλὰ πόθεν ποῖ. But this is a very different kind of material from that of the four
elements‚ which change and pass into one ¹another and act upon one another, sce
Zeller p. 437 n. 7. Cf. Phys. ii a, 1941> ἔτι τῶν πρός τιὴ ὕλη· ἄλλῳ γὰρ εἴδει ἄλλο
ὕλη. Hence many scholars have denied that A.’s αἰθήρ was material, see Zeller, note
on ἓξυῖἧὲνῖχή) belongs to all living bodies, this term including plants as wellas
animals. But soul has many faculties and plants possess only the lower facultres
contained in the nutritive soul (τὸ θρεπτικόν). Animals possess all these and also
the faculties of the sentient soul (τὸ αἰσθητικόν). The possession of each higher
faculty involves the possession of all the lower faculties. Man possessos, in ad·
dition to all lower faculdes, Reason (νοῦς); R. and P. ξ 336 and notes. Τὴε soul,
whatever faculties it may possess, is related to the body as form to matter. Itis Α
not σῶμα, but it cannot be without σῶμα. Cf. de An. ii a, 13in R. and P. ἓ 333.

The soul is not moved and is not sels-moving‚ de An. i 3 §5 1-21.

ln man the faculty of thinking upon objects of sense is lower than the faculty of
thinking upon objects of thought. This latter (νοῦς) alone may be χωριστόν, Zeller
