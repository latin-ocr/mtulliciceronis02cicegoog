INTRODUCTION

(f) Misreuding due to substitution ef a more expected fer
a less expected word.

The copyist, only partially following the sense, found a sort of
meaning in what he wrote, though as a rule he had no complete
sentence before his mind. 15 7 Socrates for Isocrates 3 ut id for nd id:
(e and t final are often interchanged‚ eg. 115 17 ad id for nt id ; 1593
ad for et; 515and582 et for sed 3 11547 senileseet for si m'lesset 3) 1516
and 5 112 habeo for uuee ; 520 uerum for nllum3 ‚5 20 se parare for
ei purere3 534 pinxit for panxit3 putus for peetus 3 538 reuocare for
reuocare 3 540 ipse for iste ; 545 patriam for patritam (contractiori
perhaps contributing and perhaps also the form of the letters ta) ;
550 une for uiue; 553 alicunde for nle'unee'e3 5 57 quusi for que si 3
562 institutiones for institiones; 5 75 uuecamus for aduncumus; 5 77
ista for ita 3 animis for nimis ; 585 tamen for tulem3 586 ut for aut ;
587 sit qui iet for eequis iet (a word ending in s preceded—eequis
was commonly copied as et quis and eand i were much confused) ;
588 nnete for mulo (the whole book being de contemnenda morte);
5 89 Lettino for Litana3 5 93 quaerendum for querendum ; 595 molestissi-
mis for mollissimis 3 598 efe'euem for Aeonem (Aeucem occurs in the
context below); 599 aut for haud 3 5 103 neque me quicquum for neque
neei quicquam ; 5109 summis for suis (the context eg. perfeeto and
cumulata contributing); 5 109 expectatur for expetatur ; 5 112 ratione for
, oratenne ¹(cf. 5116); 5 113 statutum for statum ; 5 115 lueto for let0;
5 116 quidem for qui item (in 11 5 7 some of the best mss have quidem for
qui e'dem) ; 15117 peremit for perimit; conibentem in some of the best
mss, the copyist vaguely thinking of cen and leube03 5119 if omnis
be read, s was omitted through pin'lesopln'aest being taken for philosophia
(abl.) est3 11 520 atille for uit ille3 expulit for expuli5 522 placuit
and placauit for paeanit; 5 31 dolere for dolere3 5 31 tum for dune (three
times); 5 32 siquis for si quid3 5 33 multum for mutum; 539 innecteris3
547 conexa for ceneuu.

The following are due to the same cause, modes of contraction in
some instances contributing :—

1 5 15 ecqui for ecquid ; 546 qui quod for quid qued ; 5 33, 5 59, 5 84,
596‚5 104 qued for qu03 573, 583 que for qued3 11515 que mede
for qued meei0; 1582 quonium for qu0d; 5104 quiet for qui (acc. to
another view quid for qui id); 5 109 quae for quam: also in 5110 where
see variants, 11 5 57 quae for qui; 560 qui for quin ; 557 eum est
missu for quo est missa.
