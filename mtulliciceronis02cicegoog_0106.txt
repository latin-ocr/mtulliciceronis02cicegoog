The expression is formed upon ,gom

neaux on Tac. Ann. xi ²5· Reid is
probably right in finding some sarcasm iu
the application of the expression in the
passage in the Academics: similarly

mumma: eg. those of Zeus in Crete,
Asclepios in Arcadia, and Dionysos at
Delphi. Diillinger, op. cit. 1 135, also
1148 and Cic. N.D. iii nr, 533 22, 573
Callimachus, Hymn to Jove 9. The im«

have expected the same mood in each of
these two parallel„ clauses. a and n are
apt to interchange in Mss3 so also are

most naturally taken as relative, not in·
direct interrogative. if we are to detect
any differente between the grammatical
positions of the two words we must take
tradantur as subj. of reported thought,
and suppose the appeal to A.’s reason to ·
render the word subjective.
quae natantur mysteriis: on this
subject see Lobeck’s Aglaophamur and
Do'llinger op. cit. i 125-202.
tum deniquo: different from tum
demum: tum deumne here :then you will
reabse, i.e. these preliminaries will fully
enable you to realise ; tum demum would
have meant only then, then at last, you
will realise. Cf. i 31, 75, iii 31, 75. In
the former expression the emphasis is on
tum, in the latter it is on demum.
