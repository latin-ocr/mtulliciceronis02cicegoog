EXCURSUS ll.

Nomou i 24, 56 foll.

Cicero, in this chapter, does not express himself clearly. In Cato M. 21, 78 he
successively sets forth two arguments for the immortality of the soul: (a) the soul is
not composite and therefore cannot be broken up and perish (for this argument
cf. also T.D. i 29, 71); (b) the power of ἀνάμνησις is a proof that the soul existed before
entering the body, and therefore that it will exist after it quits the body. In N. D. ii
12, 33 Cicero works out, as a proof of the divine existence, a third argument. The
argument there is as follows: there is a gradual ascent from vegetable life to animal
life, from animal life to human life; the last mentioned being distinguished by the
possession of caeca, but not ratio recta constansque. But, as all things strive after
perfectiori and as universal nature can attain to perfectiori, ther'e is a divine being
who possesses ratio recta constansque. Cf. Sext. Empir. adu. Math. ix 88.

Cic. seems to commence the chapter with the first argument before his mind: he
could understand how sanguis, bilis etc. are compounded (and therefore how they may
be broken up); bnt with regard to the soul he seems about to say that he fails to see
how it, being simplex, could be broken up, when suddenly he thinks of Plato’s ψυχή
ἄλογος and so drifts into the argument from the Scale of Existence, the third referred
to above.

For this argument see especially a very complete note in Mayor on N. D. ii ιι, 33.
According to the Stoics all things in nature are divided into four classes: the class of
inorganic objects‚ held together by ψιλὴ ἕξις, ‘the unifying principle in organic nature’
(Mayor), eg. λίθοι καὶ ξύλα; the class of plants‚ held together by φύσις, the principle of
growth (natura in our passage); the class of the lower animals, held together by a
soul (irrational); and the class of rational beings. Cf. Sext. Emp. adu. Math. ix 81
quoted by Zeller, Stoics, etc. p. 196. The history of this argument is well tracedb
Ma or. <

lThis argument, which in N .D. ii 12, 33 was employed to prove the divine existence,
is also available to prove the immortality of the soul, for the soul of man is akin to
the soul of the universe, which is the Deity. This view is Aristotelian, see Zeller 11⁹
p. 359 and n. 5. For a similar application of a proof of the divine existence to prove
the immortality of the soul cf. T.D. i 13, 3ο init.

Since the argument from the Scale of Existence depends upon the pre-eminence of
the mental powers possessed by man, Cic. further drifts from it into a fourth argu-
ment, viz. that powers so pre-eminent must belong to something immortal. This
argument is also found in the passage in Cato M. 21, 78 sr'c sentia cum tanta celeritas
animarum sit, tanta neenearia praeteritorum futurarumque prudencia, tot artes, tantae
scientiae, tal inuenta, nan posse eam naturam quae res eas contineat esse neortalenr.
Note that in our passage the words lrabel primum nrenrare'am imply that the mention
of other faculties is to follow. These follow in ι 5, 61 quid? illa uis. ln considering
Cicero’s treatment of these arguments it is to be borne in mind that Cic. does not
write this book in order to prove the immortality of the soul. His position is that
(a) if the soul is immortal death is to be despised‚ and there are arguments forits
immortality, (b) even if the soul perishes there is no evil in death, cf. i 3 3, 81. And
it must be admitted that Cic. does not state any of his arguments for the immortality of
the soul with much force of conviction.

The argument based upon the fact that the soul is simplex was the less convincing
