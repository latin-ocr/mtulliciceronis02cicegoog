INTRODUCTION xlvii

misled by a wrong idea as to the construction, or as to a grammatical Ι

form. N is thus inserted in 1580 di'cantur for dicatum §86 relinquisset
and §112 in some mss relinqueris3 §107 sentirent for sentiret ; 11 §32
audiens sor audiesJ §43 atquin for atqui ; §44 iterandum for iteradum3
ἓ 57 adforent for adferret 3 §67 quo sint for quasit. In ις 109 summis
(most uss sumis) for suis two m’s are wrongly inserted, some stroke
having probably been mistaken for a symbol for m and having also
been retained over the m because the word summis seemed to suit the
meaning. M is inserted in 15110 salaminii for salamina, the later
idiom probably contributing here as in atqui‘n3 11 ἓ 31 relinquentem for
relinquente ; ξ 4 5 breuem sor breue.

1585 uel was written for ui, ub for ui' or vt for vt. Similarly in
11 ἓ 62 ut was written for uel (ub) ἓ 91 the reading non modo non may
have arisen from a copyist mistaking non for a contractiori, eg. aba,
cf. the reading of R. ἓ 9 3 &acta i.e. et acta for exacta. §106 praessisset,
1 ἓ 114 praecatione, 115 54 praessum: these errors are due to the use of
the same contraction p to denote prae and pre. ᾗ 2 red for si, ie. s; for
si or sur sor siu. ἓ 3 exortus for exortum, probably from the mark· on
exortu being mistaken for ſs ie. s. The termination os genus may
have contributed. ἓ 18 si forts e’, ie. si sortis est, became si forta ἓ 26
nii‘r‘n or nin ie. numerum was confused with atr or an, i.e. noster. ἓ 31
frustra has probably fallen out and an abbreviation was very likely the
cause of its loss. §32 confisssu’i's seems to have taken the place of
confessuseris. §33 discere for discede'. §34 quorum nno modo for
quorum non rnoa’o, uo for no. §39 continuatus lor continuatur, ⁹ sor Ἰ,
poti (potest) for pots (potis). §42 ei'us (ειθ) fornia Cf. the form in
V G D Π Ε 2 etc. ᾗ 48 acad probably for atq,·, ie. atque. §49 dubitant
or dubitat misread as dubitare, ie. dubitarunt. ξ 52 ani'mo misread as
uero, a‘io as ab. §60 tanto opere sor tantu operq. §62 ut for uel (ub).
Similarly in ἓ 54, ob eam causam, que (q;) has sallen out after earn, the
contraction probably causing the loss. ln 1 ἓξ 30, 70 omniaque in D sor
omnique probably arose out of ab· which the copyist read as amq· merely
because omnia is os more frequent occurrence than omni. In1§98
iniquorum uentos seems to have arisen from writing ru sor cleu. Com-
pare the reading os K.

Two very important illustrations of this error require special notice.
In 11 ἕ 13 the best mss have acinprobe or acinprobe. This must have
arisen out ol aii probe, the flat mark above the c indicating con-
traction, in this case due to writing a single sor a double letter.
This flat mark was mistaken sor the symbol which denotes the
omission of norm and was supposed to belong to the i, hence the
us reading. The reading of 011 seems very significant.
