suggestive of Epicurus. L. Reinhardt1 thinks that we have here an
attempt of Cicero to solve a philosophie problem by means of rhetoric,
or an attempt to shew how far he can go when he philosophises by
means of his own resources alone.

ᾖ rit-2 5. Kiihner is uncertain whether the various views of philo-
sophers here stated with regard to the soul have been collected by
Cicero or copied from the work of some Greek philosopher. Heine is
uncertain whether these views have been derived from the same source
as the matter for the discussion that follows, but is certain that
they were not collected by Cicero. L. Reinhardt thinks that the
remarks about the theory that cor=onimus and about concordes etc,
shew that ἐ 18 belongs to Cicero himself and not to a philosopher who
had thought out the contrast between soul and body. From 5 21 he
finds that Cicero had Dicaearchus' Κορινθιακοὶ λόγοι before him and that
Dicaearchus in his first book brings in many philosophers as speaking,
and he therefore sets down Dicaearchus as the source for Q ψη and
also sor ᾗ 41, which he shews to be very closely parallel to these
sections. Ι take it to be clear that §41 is derived from the same source
as ᾖ 19-22, but I think it probable that that source was Posidonius.

&26-49. The arguments contained in these sections Kiihner thinks

⁷ derived from Stoic sources, with Roman illustrations introduced by

Cicer0, and some views drawn from other systems or put forward as
his own.

Chapters 2²·34 (ἐξ 50-81 incl.) Kiihner regards as almost wholly
taken from Plato. That Cicero had a work of Panaetius before him he
thinks clear from ἐξ 42 and 78. That somebody (i Posidonius the pupil
of Panaetius) had Panaetius before him seems clear from the present
sections. The view of Heine which derives ἓξ 26-81 throughout from a
Stoic source, and in fact from Posidonius, seems far more satisfactory.
There seems to be very little in these sections that Posidonius might
not have written if we except the Roman illustrations, and these are
unusually few. I see no evidence to shew that in 3556& 5 Cicero may
not have derived the basis of his arguments from Posidonius. Itis
quite possible that Posidonius used the argument from Ἀνάμνησις, as
Heine evidently thinks, but on the other hand he may not have accepted

this doctrine, and Cicero may have worked it in independently of his
source. Cicero deals with this doctrine in a very inaccurate and per-
functory manner, and the attempt at contaminatio may be one cause of
the confusion of thought which is very noticeable in these sections,
The argument from the simple nature of the soul is Platonic, but may
