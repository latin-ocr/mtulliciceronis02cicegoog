P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum
was a grandson ol Cn. Scipio who lell in
Spain during the Second Punic War‚ and
son of the Nasica who received the statue
of Cybele when it was brought irom Pes·
sinus to Rome. He was son·in·law of
Africanus the elder, andwas distinguished
in oratoryand in law. ὑί· ²⁹¹ '

egregie cordatus homo...‚ aline from
Ennius' Ananis, quoted three times by
Cicero.

Sex. Aelius Q. F. P. N. Paetus Catus
was consalin 198 ac.. as appears lrom
the Fasti Capitolini. This inscription
seems to shew that Catus was part of his
name, and not a mere attribute like
Sapiens in the case ol Laelius Sapiens.

[I doubt the argument from the Fasti
Capit-3 it attributes too much to their
authority. They were greatly influenced
by late antiquarian researches‚ such as
tho'se made by Varro and Atticus]

5 1⁹. empedocles ol Agrigentum, flor.

about 460 ac. Considerable fragments
of his poem περὶ φύσεως survive. Cic.
here makes E. declare the soul to be the
blood around the heart, a view actually
held by Critias the pupil oi Socrates.
Cic. was probably misled bya line pre·
served in Stobaeus, Ecl. Phys. i p. 1026
αἷμα γάρ ἀνθρώπως περικάρδιάν ἐστι
νόημα. But the two preceding lines
quality this statement-

αἳματος ἐν πελάγεσσι τεθραμμένη ἀντι·

θροῶντος
τῇ τε νόημα μάλιστα κυκλίσκεται ἀνθρώ·
τοισιν,

where τεθραμμένη refers to κραδίη.

Empedocles made the four elements
enter into the composition oi the soul,
and held that we perceive each external
object by means of the corresponding
clement in our soul: cf. γαίη μὲν γὰρ
γαῖαν ὀπώπαμεν ὕδατι δ’ ὕδωρ κ.τ.λ.,
quoted by Arist. de Anima i a, 6; cl'.
also Theophr. de Sens. 10 ὡσαύτως δὲ
λέγει (Ἐμπεδοκλῆς) καῖ περὶ φρονήσεως
καὶ ἀγνοίας· τὸ μὲν γάρ φρονεῖν εἶναι τοῖς
ὁμοίοις, τὸ δὲ ἀγνοεῖν τοῖς ἀνομοίοις...διά
καὶ τηῖ αἵματι μάλιστα φρονεῖν, ἐν τούτῳ
γὰρ μάλιστα τῶν μερών κεκρᾶσθαι τὸ.
στ’ῗλίίεειαάηά the remarks that follow shew
that it was because Emped. thought the
four elements to be best mixed at the
heart that he supposed that to be the seat
of thought, yet not exclusively its seat,
for he goes on to say that excellence in a
single department is due to the μέση
κρᾶσις being ina single part, orators t'or
instance having it ἐν τῇ γλώττῃ, and
craitsmen ἐντοῖς χερσί. In i 17, 4¹ Cic.
speaks more correctly, in Enpedoclen
sanguine ἀίσσοντο.

alli ln eorda: the Stoics held that the
dominant part of the soul. the hyspaniam,
had its seat in the heart, see Zeller, c. ix,
