lxii IN TRODUCT [ΟΝ

§45 The utterances of Epicurus are unsatisfactory. We must go to
’ those schools in which the honourable is held to be the chief good and
the base the chief evil. &44-5.

If you hold this view you must control yourself : your reason must
control your lower nature, ἓξ 47-8.

This lower nature may require extreme coercion and the calling in
of extemal assistance—cf. uinciatur, etc. (This seems metaphorical: if
your own force of will does not avail, regard for your friends' opinion—
cf. fractos pudore—must assist) ἕ 48. Or in a less extreme case it may
only require firm control (cf. at imperator militi) 3 an illustration from
Pacuvius, §g 49, 50. But in the case of the perfect philosopher the
lower nature obeys the higher as readily as a good child obeys a just
parent, 5 51. This selfcontrol is brought about by resolution, firmnesS,
and sels-examination, ξ 51. Think of noble examples: eg. those of
Zeno of Elea; Anaxarchus the Democritean3 Calanus; C. MariuS,
§552-3·

This exercise of sels-control and bracing up of one's resolution not
only brings the lower nature into subjection‚ but actually makes pain
lighter, ἐξ 5'3-4. Think of the disgrace of crying out under pain,
ἐξῇ-7. Think how noble it is to endure pain calmly, ᾖ 58. This
thought inspires heroes in battle, ξ 593 and philosophers, eg. Posidonius,
ἓ 61 (Dionysius of Heraclea was an apostate, §60); and all who endure
hardships for the sake of glory, §g 62, 63. But the verdict of one’s own
conscience affords a higher and truer testimony, g 64 This endurance
of pain, since it must proceed from lixed philosophie principles, must
be uniform and invariable, ἓ 65.

Pain, then, is either not an evil or, if it be an evil, it is an evil

so slight that virtue, ie. fortitude, reduces it to insignificance, especially
as death is always available as a release, ἐξ 66, 67.

SECTION V.
On the Spalding adopted in the Text.

. The best Mss seem in the main to afford excellent guidance in
matters of spelling, andin most instances to preserve the actual forms
used by Cicero, Although Ι do not attempt to set up the text exactly as
it came from Cicero, Ι have followed the best mss wherever they agree
in presenting forms which we know to have been used in Cicero's time.

The mss have usually adf-, adg, adn, ads, not aff, ag· or agg, ann,
ass, cf. adfert 180, 82, 94, afferren 1 114, aaflicta 11 213 adgnoscere 1 58
