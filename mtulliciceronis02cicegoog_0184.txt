ble. Some second-rate uss read cou-
currerunt, others and some early editions
read cucurrerunt; some early editions
cucurrere. The compound is to be
preferred on its own merits as well as
on the authority of the Mss. cou-
denotes collision with the enemy, as
often in this word, not vehemence or
convergence in attacking, as some editors
have supposed.

st timeretur...eouctdtsset: for the
tense cf. 11, 17 n. on ‘nisi haereret.’

1.. Brutus: cf. Livy ri 6.

Decius: the reference in pater is to
the fight at Veseris 340 B.c.; infilius to
Sentinum ²95 B.c.; and in nepos to
Asculum 279 uc. Mommsen ΚΗ. 1
36611. doubts the sels-immolation of the
father, but, though he shews that the
narrative of the first Samnite-Latin wat
of the Romans bristles with absurdities,
he puts forward no convincing argument
on this particular point; for it wasa
common belief among earlier warriors
that one man by sacrificing his own life
could involve in his destruction that of
the hostile army, and the renowu ac·
quired by a father by such an act would
strongly stimulate his son to repeat
the act.

F or the practice of sels-immolation and
its meaning see Preller‚ Rtm. Myer.
466-9; Mayor on Juw. viii 257 and further
references there.

With regard to the grandson Cic.
repeats in Fin. ii 19, 61 the assertion
here made ‘seque...tertiam uictimam rei
publicae praebuisset.’ But in Off. iii 4,
16; Cato M. 1ο, 753 Diui. 14, 513
Paradoxa 11 he only refers to two Decii,
and Zonaras Anu. viii 5 definitely asserts
that before the battle of Asculum Pyrrhus,

finding his soldiers disturbed by a rumout
that Decius was preparing to imitate his
father and grandfather, ascertained the
garb worn by those who devoted them·
selves in battle, forbade his men to slay
anyone so arrayed, and sent word to
Decius that if he made the attempt he
would be taken alive and put to death
by torture; whereupon the consuls replied
that they bad no need to have recourse to
any such plan. Zonaras also indicates
that both consuls survived the battle.
Moreover, the fact that the battle resulted
in victory for Pyrrhus (cf. Mommsen 1
414) shews that the devotion if historic
was ineffective.

santonas: Publius, the father, and
Gneius the uncle of Scipio Africanus
Maior. These two commanders fell in
Spain in 111-111 B.c., Gneius a few days
later than Publius. 1.. Aemilius Paulus
consul in 116 tac. and cn. Servilius (te-
minus consul in 117 uc. fell at Cannae.
11. cunutus 1111111111, who took Syra·
cuse in 111 13.c., fell in a skirmish near
Venusia in 208 uc.

urtam: the best MSS have latina.
The emendation (which Mo. ascribes to
Billerbeck‚Or.andSchichetoLindemann,
Ktih. to Menkius) is rendered certain by
Livy xxiii 14, 7 ‘silua erat uasta (Litanam
Galli uocabant)...ibi Postumius (ie. con·
sul L. Postumius Albinus) omni ui, ne
caperetur, dimicans occubuit.’

Lucanf: Or. conjectured and Mo. ac·
cepted Lucania thinking Lucani a copy·
ist's substitution for Lucania, after Litana
had been corrupted into Latini.

[Lucentz Wo’lffliu in Arcti. xu 33²
points to the absence of Lucania at
this time(1 had noticed it). He says it
uo more existed than Bruttium os
