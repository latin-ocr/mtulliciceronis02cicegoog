sententra. Ktth. holds that ·em was the
usual acc. ending sor such nouns iu Latin
writers of the golden age but that -a
sometimes occurs3 and that ·am belongs
to writers subsequent to that age.

tropea in the sense of uictoriae be·
longs rather to poetry. The same use
occurs in Corn. Nep. Themist. 5, 3
‘Marathoni0...tropaeo.'

memoriam: obruet is carried on but
no longer with Neptunus as subject.
obliuia would be the natural subject,
and this Reiske wished to insert after
quam. I fail to see any idea in Neptunus
which can be carried on as subject here.
The sentence seems too short to admit of
the theory that Cic. wrote quam (sc.
obruet) Sal. trop. memoriam meaning to
write quam obruetur Sal. trop. memorio.
If obruetur fell out after quam (or after
tropaei) a copyist would probably bring
menearr'a into construction by changing it
into nteruorr‘om.

Boeotia: may be adj. and may be
added, as Ktih. and TS. note, because
there were towns called Λεῦκτρα (Λεῦκ-
τρον) in Arcadia and Laconia as well as
in Boeotia. The instructive addition
would then be parallel to 38, 9² ‘Latmo
...qui est mons Cariae‚’ where see note.
There is also a fair sense in ‘sooner will

Boeotian Leuctra be removed thau the
glory os Leuctra's fight.’ The expression,
however, hardly seems natural and, when
the miraculous removal of a substantia]
portionas the earth’s crust is referred to,
the place whence or the place whither is

usually indicated. Ι therefore believe .

that e has fallen out after priusque and
that the meaning is ‘sooner will Leuctra
be removed from Boeotia than the glory
of Leuctra's fightff It may also be noted
that in the examples in the immediate

« context an object (person or country) is

specified to which the glory attaches. Vl
inserts e and Ol has a.

[I have also conjectured e Boeotia3 but
possibly Boeotis. Leuctra Boeotia tollen-
tur is hardly in line with Leg. Agr. 1
§19 ‘Capua...sustulerunt’; or Verr. a,
a, 51 ‘Syracusis Marcellia tolluntur! In
favour ofe might be quoted Verr. a, a, 4
‘urbem ex sociorum insula tollendam';
a, a, 9¹ ‘urbem ex Italia pulcherrimam
non sustulerunt’]

Calatinum: 7, 13 n.

duo: for duo as acc. Brutus refers to
Charisius i, p. 101 who quotes Aen. xii
(more correctly xi 285) ‘si duo praeterea
tales Idaea tulisset' and Attius, Epinausi·
mache’ (Ribbeck rp.178‚l. 321l· See
also Neue Formenlehre, ed. 3, vol. 11
pp. 279 sq. [l believe Cic. wrote duos,
ambos, exclusively.]

arripuerit r ,the word suggests eager·
