from that of the Spartan soldier because
the hardships of the Roman soldier on
the march were notorious (Virg. Geo. iii
347), while the Spartan when on cam-
paign was relieved from many of the
hardships which he constantly endured in
time of peace, Plut. Lyc. aa, a ὥστε
μόνοις ἀνθρώπων ἐκείνοις τῆς εἰς τὸν πόλε-
μον ἀσκήσεως ἀνάπαυσιν εἶναι τὸν πολε·
μον.

iter and aa are Sfs.'s brilliant emenda·
tions. iter (id) was omitted by hoplo-
graphy after -it in procedet, and od
modum, written odorodum, was mistaken
for the adverb and so led to the changing
of oc to orl. ac is the reading of Ga.
Sff. cites Val. Max. ii 6, a ‘Lacedaemo-
niorum exercitus non ante ad dimicandum
descendere solebant, quam tibiae con-
centu (cf. od tibiam) et anapaesti pedis
modulo (cf. od modum) cohortationis
calorem animo traxissent’ Lamb. had
arrived at the same meaning by reading
procedit ogrrrerr od modum ad tibiam.
Schiche reads procedit ocris orl modum
tibicinum.

tibiam: the Spartans marched to the
sound of the dute, not to that of the
trunrpet3 cf. Thuc. v 7ο; Plut. Lyc.
22, 3 ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐξῆρχεν ’ἐμβαπηρίου
παιᾶνος ὥστε σεμνὴν ἅμα rol καταπλη-
κτικὴν τὴν ὄψιν εἶναι ῥυθμῷ πρὸς τὸν
αὐλὸν ἐμβαινόντων. Muller, Doricus ἸΙ
346. The fluteplayers formed a heredi·
tary class at Sparta, Herod. vi 60.

anapaestis pedibus: Neidius quotes
two lines of an ἐμβαπήριον in anapaestic
metre from Hephaestion Alexandrinus:
ἄγετ’ ὦ Σπάρτας ἔνοπλοι κοῦροι, ποτὶ πὰν
'Apsos rtvootv.

nomen: sc. ob exercmdo.

qut labor, quantus agminis: I have
not found a close parallel to this asynde·
ton, yet the expression would be less im·
pressive if with several editors (Mo. TS.
Hei. Schiche) we were to insert et. Ktth.
observes ‘asyndeton in gradatione aptis·
simum est.’

plus dimidiatt menate: in Caes. B. C.
i 78 the soldiers are ordered to carry aa
days' provisions: in Livy xliv a, 4 one
months provisions; in Livy Epit. 57,
30 days' provisions and 7 stakes apiece.
Plut., Flamininus 5, a, refers to the Ro-
man soldiers abstaining from plundering
though their month's rations had not
been served out to them. Cf. Vegetius i
l? ..tait ‘illlalsstllattlttl
From Plut. Mar. 13, 1 it seems to follow
that the soldiers did not always carry all
their baggage themselves; Plutarch as·
serts that when Marius compelled them
to do so, the name of ‘Marius’ mules’
became proverbial for all those who
obeyed severe orders without grumbling.
Plutarch, however, as Dr Reid points out,
completely misunderstood the phrase

’νιιιιΙί Mariani. [Cf. Frontinus, Strateg.

4, r ἓ 7 ‘C. Marius recidendorum im·
pedimentorum gratia, quibus maxime
exercitus agmen oneratur, uasa et cibaria
militum in fasciculis aptata furcis im·
posuit, sub quibus et habile onus et facilis
requies esset. unde et in prouerbium
tractum est : muli Marioni.' The ref. in
Festus 149 is to the same effect. It was
the device wh. was called mulus, not
the soldiers. In camp language animal
names were applied to many devices.
See also Paul. ex F est. su. oerumnulos:
‘aerumnulas Plautus refert furcillas qui·
bus religatas sarcinas uiatores ferebant.
qnorum usum quia C. Marius rettulit
muli Mariani postea appellabantur.']

plus: quom is more often omitted than
expressed with specifications of time and
measure, cf. Sest. 39', 85 ‘plus uiginti
uolneribus acceptis’; Caes. B. G. i38‚5
‘spatium non amplius pedum sescento-
rum'; B.G. v 53, 7 ‘longius milia
passuum octd.'

non plus numerant, ‘they do not
reckon as anything more than‚' ‘they
reckon as little as.' Madv. 305 obs. a.
