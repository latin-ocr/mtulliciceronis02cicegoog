copied from an excellent source. This source may have been an uncial
ms as the words in the original were not separate. Be is very closely
related to R and possibly copied from the same original. The original
of R was beginning to go to pieces when R was copied from it. The
original of Be had fallen still more to pieces by the time that B 2 was
written. B 2 omits from 115 45 ege summum dolerem to 111 ἓ 12 ‘mim'me'
inquit ‘adsentior' After the lacuna come 111 ἐς 12-82 to the words ita
fieri oportere. Then v 26 qui melius quam fortunam to v 69 uel ani-
martes. Then 1v 70 ut opinio mea fert to v 26 ad uoluptatem referret.
Then 111 82 tae detracto to iv 70 cum Epicuro nen multum. 'l‘hen v 69
uel muti uel loquentis origo to the end of Bk v. In R the passage from
decumbere, 11 ἓ 41, to sire autern raderet, 111 ἓ 19, is out of place. This
includes the passage lost from 132 and two or three leaves besides. If
both uss are copies of the same original, that original had been stitched
up after R was copied and had subsequently fallen very much to pieces.

K. No. 8423 943 in Omont, Catalegue depart. xv11 p. 390, where
it is referred to the ninth century. Itis written on parchment in light
brown inlr, 220 millimetres by 193. The words are very much'run
together, this being probably an indication that the us has been
directly copied from an uncial us Contractions are much more
freely used than in RV or G. The book consists of 46 double pages
and two single pages, the first and last. It contains the Tusculan
Disputations only. There is no ornamentation whatever. Corrections
have been made, some in brown ink, perhaps of the same date as the
MS, others in dark brown ink, and in a somewhat later hand 3 and
