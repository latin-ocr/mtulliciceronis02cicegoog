On despriing deatla

Cicero, released by the Civil War from sorensic and political duties‚
attempts to give his countrymen a system of philosophy in their own
language. The subject could be learnt from Greek teachers, but Cicero
holds the Romans capable of improving upon the Greeks in any
department in which they think it worth their while to do s0. He will
therefore enrich the native literature, the more so as certain Epicurean
writers have already written on philosophy in Latin with little regard
for style. §51-6.

Accordingly, having friends assembled recently at his Tusculan
villa, he discussed on five successive days five subjects severally
suggested by certain os those present. The first proposition put forward
for discussion was That death is an errr'l: and an evil both to the dead
and to the living, as the proposer goes on to admit, and, since an evil,
a source of wretchedness, and this wretchedness continues for ever.
llet the wretched dead are not in Tartarus, they are nowhere at all 3
but they are wretched just because they are non-existent. Then after
some quibbling on both sides the interlocutor admits that the dead are
not wretched 3 but are not the living wretched inasmuch as they must
die? &7-14. No, replies Cicero, for dying is only a passing into
astate in which there is no evil. Rather Cicero would endeavour to
shew that death so far from being an evil is actually a good. Q 15, 16.
This leads to the question What is deatlzl And what is tlte soul or
where is it sz'tuated or whence does it come? Various views are stated,
ἐξ 18-24, and the interlocutor admits that the soul either remains aster
death or is extinguished at death, and that il it remains aster death it is
happy, and if it is extinguished at death it is not unhappy since it
is non-existent. 525.

The rest of the argument falls into two divisions :—

A. Cicero in ἓξ 26-81 sets forth arguments to shew that the soul is
immortal, and that death in that case is a good rather than an evil.

I. That there is a naturally implanted belief in immortality is
attested by the following facts :-(a) it was the view of all earlier men
as indicatedby their care with regard to rites ol sepulture, ᾗ ²73 and
by their practice of deifylng illustrious men and women. ἐξ 28-9.
(b) Itis shewn by the present consensus gentium—the universal practice
