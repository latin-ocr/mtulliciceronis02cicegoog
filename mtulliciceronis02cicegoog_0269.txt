‚equoue lassus ab indomito uel si Ro· libera, but the word usuallymeaus ‘good-

mana fatigat militia...' and Epp. i a, 67
‘militat in siluis catulus! If we r.tain
militia we must take it in the sense of
military training, ‘drill,' and refer it to
the rigorous training to which the women
as well as the men at Sparta were sub·
jected. It must be admitted that an
exact parallel to this use has not been
put forward. But Bouhier's labar mili·
tiae. adopted by many edd. incl. Keh.
and Schiche, besides departing from the
Mss involves giving the word either this
meaning or that of ‘hunting.' The
emendation of Sff. ririlitrae at studia is
at first sight plausible, for the use would
be obviously metaphorical, but fertilitas
barbara could not be said ritilt'tiae esse
to the women with whom these are con·
trasted, and militiae does not seem to
occur elsewhere as a predicative dative.
Rohy 11 introd. p. xlviii gives no in-
stance.

fertilltae: this word has proved very
troublesome. If sound, it must have the
meaning of rolurervla, fecunditas being
the more usual word in this sense. The
poet need not imply that Spartan women
have few children or none; he merely
says that their mind is centred not upon

· children but upon the things mentioned
in the previous line, while women of other
nations are devoted to indoor life, their
households, and their children.

Nissen thought that fertilitas barbara
meant (luxurious) ‘products of foreign
(extra-Spartan) lands,' hut this would be
much more obscurely expressed than the
meaninglhave suggested above nor would
the contrast bevery complete or pointed.
facilitas, found in a few late and inferior
nss, was favoured hyEm. in the sense of
uita facilis, trita a rrralestis laboribus

nature,’ ‘willingness to oblige.’ Bent.
proposed fittr'litas barbara. A good
suggestion is sent to me by Dr Reid, who
thinks that mttttta has been corrupted
from mollitia bythe influence of militr'am
below and that fertilitas and mollitia
have interchanged places. The conjec-
tures of other scholars seem irreconcilable
with the ns reading.

barbara: must refer to non-Greeks.
Or. refers to the 17 children of Hecuba,
50 of DanauS, 50 of Aegyptus.

callum...obdualt: cf. iii 22, 53.

XVI. §aa mfltttam uero: Cic. in-
tended to write something like rrir'lr'tiam
uero quantum laborem arferat uides; but,
as militia implies exercitas, an argument
from the etymology of exercitus occurring
to him interrupted the construction. Had
the sentence taken its original course we
should have had an instance of the same
attraction as in i ²4, 56 n., ‘sanguinem....’
As it is we have that attraction andan
anacolouthon as well.

Enrendations are unnecessary and un·
satisfactory. J. F. Gronovius' militiae
in the sense ofin expeditione would be
contrasted here with gymnastic exercises,
whereas Cic, as Sff. points out, contrasts
the word regularly with danii, the latter
word being expressed. sff. himself pro-
posed in militia uera, and Lamb. rrrilitia
uere and lrabeat; the former mode of ex·
pressiori is not usual in the sense of quad
rtera ad militiam attinet, while the latter
would derive the etymological argument
from militia not from exercitas.

nostram dieo, non spartiatarum:
though he has been dealing with the
gymnastic exercises of the Spartans in
the previous chapter, Cic. illustrares from
the experience of the Roman rather than
