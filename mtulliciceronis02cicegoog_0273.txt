words would fitly be spoken by Patroclus
in the play when he recognised Eurypylus
whom they served to introduce to the
spectators. Cic. perhaps extended the
quotation so as to include thern 101 a
similar reason, as Eurypylus had not yet
been mentioned by name. Some have
supposed the words to belong to Cic, not
to the dramatist.
