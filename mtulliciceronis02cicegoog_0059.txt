liv INTRODUCTION

(d) Mc'sreading due to a tluory as to tlu construction.

Copyists very commonly followed the sense of what they were
writing but only to an imperfect extent, that not being their main
business. Hence they were apt at times to write down the construction
which their mind was led to expect rather than that actually presented
to their eye.

1537 apertae nostia for opertaen ostro: apertae being brought into
construction with animae3 olto VBE instead of altae to agree with
ostro 3 5 38 honore disciplina for honore disciplinam 5 54 se ipsam for
se ipsa3 5 62 anianus for animo (a symbol may here have contributed);
580 dicantur for dicotur: but similar instances of plural for singular are
very common in the best inss3 something in the formation of the letter c
may have been mistaken for the flat mark that denoted the letter n.
594l1omiru's for lamani, to depend upon prudentia 3 5 102 morte for
mortem; 5106 suspenso for suspensam (suspenso) to agree with soruno 3
5107 sensu omnc'a for sensu omni to agree with saxa; 5109 quae for
qnam to agree with tempestiua; 5 115 omnes for orrzni to agree with
amicos; 115 5 graecia for graeciae (abl. of separation or abl. abs
imagined) ; this may also explain 5 10 mei or meae nimis, but see
explanatory note there; 5 11 ipsi sibi for ipse sibi 3 516 dicere and
depellere for dt'cerm and depellerere due to se taking the place of scilicet
and the constr. being supposed to be acc. and infinitive (a contractiori
of depellerere may have contributed). 5 22 taetram for taetra, to agree
· with [eruom3 obtutum for obtutu made to agree with arborem; in 5 24
the reading iecur seems due to an attempt to make that word the
subject ; 531 dolere for dolore. 537 oc changed to ad before taleam
when iter fell out; 5 39 luctum for luctus to agree with tantum3 540 in
niue, iu orantibus for in montc'bus, uiue; 550 opprimite for opprrmit3
551 suscitabitur for suscitabat, it not being seen that the reflexive is
carried on.

(e) Misreoding duc to a word in clu context.

1 5 5 Catonem for Carbonem (Catonem occurs four words earlier) ;
581 similitudines for dissimilitudines (siruilr‘tudo and similitudinem occur
in the two preceding lines) ; 582 quoniam for quod helped by quoniam
in the preceding line; 582 et for sed, the following et being supposed
co-ordinate (the similarity of the words also contributed); 585 occultasset
for occidisset (mordere occurs four words earlier); 5 88 morte for molo, as
Ι conjecture (morte precedes four lines earlier); 5105 Hectorem for
Hectora (Hectorem occurs three times in the next preceding lines);
5116 rotronis for orationis (rationes preceded) 3 115 60 deductus for
dedoctus (deduxisset occurs just below).
