Museum (15 Β xv). This MS also belonged formerly to the
King’s Library and its collation had been hegun by Bentley
(see Introduction).

ΒΖ though a late MS is faithfully copied from an early one
and is worthy of a place in the first class. It has never been
collated before, nor, so far as Ι know, referred to by any scholar.

J is a good MS of the second class, preserved in the Library
of St John's College, Cambridge. This MS, which has never
been collated before, very closely approaches one of the Vienna
MSS (Kiihner's Vind. 1, my W 2).

Other MSS here collated have never been fully collated in
any previous edition. Some of these are very important.

The Vatican MS 3246 is second to none and the corrections
which it contains are as important as are the original readings.

The Vienna, Munich‚ and Duisburg MSS have had very great
influence upon the formation of the text. The citations of
editors fr'om these MSS and especially from Dare very frequently
wrong. .

Five Palatine MSS are referred to in Gruter’s Hamburg
edition of 1618 as having been collated for the editor by
Andreas Schottus. l have only found four Palatine MSS of the
Tusculans in the Vatican Library. Of these P1 distinctly
belongs to the first class.

The necessity for a proper collation of the Berne MS is l think
obvious. The Peterhouse MS (H) is referred to here and there
by Davies and subsequent editors but has never been fully col-
lated. A Cambridge MS is also referred to as Cantab. If this
is identical with the MS now in the Cambridge Univ. Library ’
(my C) its readings have often been very inaccurately quoted by
Davies and subsequent editors C is very closely related to D
and Π to E2. Both C and Π are good second-class MSS.

The previous editions of which I have most frequently made
use in writing the explanatory notes are those of J. Davies (here
referred to as Dav.); J. C. Orelli, Zurich, 1829 and Oxford,
1834 (Or.); G. H. Moser, Hanover, 1836 (Mo.); G. Tischer
edited by G. Sorof, 6th ed. Berlin, 1872 (TS.); R. Kiihner‚
5th ed. Hanover, 1874 (Kiih.); Ο. Heine, 4th ed. Leipzig,
1892 (Hei).

The following editions are also referred to:
