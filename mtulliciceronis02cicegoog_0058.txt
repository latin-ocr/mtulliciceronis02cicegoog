INTRODUCTION liii

And o for to.
1545 petriam for patritam.

Not dissimilar is tic for te.
1582 Democrite'ci for Democritei.

And ct sor t.

15110 expectatur for expetatur3 11519 expectens for expetens.
E sometimes occupies more space than a single letter usually
occupies‚ and the abbreviation ὢν for et is sometimes rather like cet.

n for o.
11 5 46 utar for utor.

u for o.
11 5 30 furtunae forfortunae5 5 52 conscius sor conscios; 560 deductus
for dedoctus.
osor u.

11 5 2 3 soboles lor suboles; 1 57 commotus ior curn motus; 11545 qui-
cumplures for qui complerem 541 consolatus for consulatus. Here and in
furtunae forfortunne, and in some other instances, the copyist seems to

have been misled by looking sorward to the vowel of the following
syllable. ln consolatus the first o has probably brought in the second o.
When he wrote utar for utor he may have expected almuse, and conscius
lor conscios may have been due rather to an idea os the construction than
to any resemblance of the o to u. Deductus took the place of dedoctus
as being the more familiar word and being suggested by the context.

ae for c and e for ae.

ae was very commonly written y and often e, hence confusion arose.
1 5 93 quaerendum for querendum ; 11 5 39 bocetoris or baec toris sor
hectoris,

Other instances os misreading of one' or more letters are
15 55 illurn sor c'llucl3 5 85 seclusa sor sed usa ; 1152 liberentur for
liberemur 3 11 5 20 exorbuit for es⁴sorbuit3 5 ²7 eiciuntur and ducuntur for
eiciuntur: cf. Madv. on Fin. v. 19, 513 5 31 entreeris for intuens: rl
for n, or the abbreviation Ἰ for ·. 537 foret sor feret ; 538 pronum
for tironnm3 5² 40 inde for uide.

Proper names are very apt to be misread. The most striking
instance is 1 5 101 Senn'clam for Leonibus.
