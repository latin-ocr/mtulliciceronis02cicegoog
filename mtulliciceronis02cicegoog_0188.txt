reliquos dormiat. ne sues quidem id uelint, non modo ipse.
Endymion uer0, si fabulas audire uolumus, ut nescio quando in
Latmo obdormiuit, qui est mons Cariae, nondum, opinor, est
experrectus. num igitur eum curare censes, cum Luna laboret?

colloquial Latin, to denote what' rs, and death, since both states are equally

will prove to be, the fact, cf. Ter.

quiescet’ (Mayor's n). See also ιι,

§92 renunt: pres. of the attempt
:fingunt TS. compares p. Flacco ιο,

pecuniam sumpsit mutuam’

uolunt: cf. 18, 42 ιι.

aues· not even the pig (proverbially
the most stupid of animals and a famous
sleeper) would wish that, so far from
man himself (of whom mehtal activity is
the distinctive characteristic) wishing 1t.
The contrast is somewhat awkwardly
expressed by Cic, as man in general
must be supplied by inference from quis-
quam ‘any one at all.' To avoid this
many editors (TS. Kl. Bai. Ml. Hei.
Schiche) have adopted Keil’s conjecture
sui which is also the reading of J. But
there does not seern sufficient reason for
departing from the Mss. Moreover in
many cases a man’s relations would
prefer having him with them asleep,
(say) from his 60th to his poth year, to
burying him ιιι his 60th year.

non modo ipso cf. Diu.' ιι 55,113

arcem tanti debere esse.' The more
usual fonn of expression would be non
modo ipse sed ne sues quidem.

marked by absence of consciousness.;
Even a sleep like that of Endymion!
is unrelieved by any pleasure srnce there ³
isa total absence of consciousness. k'ou‘ '
do nott ear sleep3 there rs then no reason “
tofear death. Cf. Fin. vro, 55 ‘itaque,

usuros putemus, Endymionis somnum ε
nobis uelimus dari, idque si accidat,¹.
mortis instar putemus?

legend cf. Geddes on Plato, Phaeds

qul est mona canae: Bake, followed
by Bai. and TS , bracketed these words
as a marginal gloss; but Cic. often has
similar geographica} notes and Dav. well
observes that on the same principle
‘fluuium qui ab Europae parte in Pontum
influit' in 39, 94 might be condemned as
a loss.

guplnorr ironical, as often, and with·
out connexion with the construction of
the sentence; so credo, puto, reor, spero.
See Ktih. on ιι, 5ι credo.

laboret. subj. of reported thought.
For the expression cf. Virg. Ge0.'’ u 478
‘defectus solis uarios lunaeque labores.'
The expression seems to have come
down from the time when an eclipse was
supposed to be due to an attempt of a ι
monster to swallow the moon, or sun.

autem, ‘moreover,’ not ‘but' The
emendation of Sti. quid curet etiam is
therefore not required, cf. ι, 3ιι.
