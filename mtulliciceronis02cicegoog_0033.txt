Where V² is rightly altered it very commonly agrees with D C 07
Wr and often with M 1. Where the alteration of V* seems wrong but
may be right it agrees in one case with W 1, in two with D C, and in
three it is alone in its reading. Where V' is obviously wrong it agrees
in only one instance with D C. This shews that the peculiarities in
DC have not come down from the immediate source of ν’.

Among the mss which have been due to compilation from both
groups are Ο 2 12 (closely related); O 34 (very closely related); 06 10
(closely related); O5 (related to 0610 but not so closely); and 01.
Of these Mss the last stands nearest in the main to the Mss of group β.
R 7 R 17 and G3 are noteworthy mss which elude classification in either
group and seem to have had their text formed on an eclectic principle.

The same principle seems to have been at work upon Wr 2 M 1 2,
which belong mainly to the β group, but their texts seem to owe

something to the α group and still more to shew signs of interchange of
readings within the β group.
