xlviii IN T RODUC TION

Similarly in 11 ἓ 62 the original must have had conte'fflo, the mark of
contractiori here as in the previous instance indicating that the letters
over which it was placed were to be repeated, the true reading being
contendendo. The flat mark was here again mistaken for the symbol
which denotes the omission of n orm and was supposed to belong only
to the e; hence V¹ faithfully, though erroneously‚ presents contemndo.

The scribes of R G P L seem to have made the same mistake and
further to have mistaken d for p, and transposed pn reading contempno.
Of inferior nrss one group made the meaningless contempno into con-
temptu, another rnade contemndo into contemnendo.

Similarly in 1 57 the reading of R, respondem, I take to have arisen
thus :—a copyistread respondentem as respondentem and abbreviated ⁴·
this into respondem the mark of contraction being omitted by a subse-
quent copyist.

In 11567 for omittas timorem I believe the archetype to have had

onriairrwortd, the mark over the second T was mistaken for s=s
just as in 11 ξ 3 where exoriri: exortum became exortus. The copyist of

G disregarded the mark over the first T: others wrote TT, rather perhaps
because they knew that the letter ought to be doubled than because
they understood the symbol. We preserves the second flat mark, but
over the a instead of over the following t.

Ι believe that many of the errors in the Tusculan Disputations and
in other classical works, usually set down to haplography, are due rather
toa misunderstanding of the use of this flat mark. It was much used
to denote contractioris of various kinds This use continued down to
the introduction of printing in the case of the omission of n orm and
in the case of various words in common use, eg. c*a=causo, izsnnt,
e'=est. lt appears to have been used to denote the omission of one of
two identical letters, syllables or other groups of letters, and to have
ceased to be so used agood while before the use of uncial script was
abandoned. The reading of V¹ above (contemndo) seems to point to
this conclusion. This theory also accounts for the coming in of the flat
mark in 11 13, as above. ltsccomr'tnm in 11 61 is not easily accounted for
on the theory of three instances of haplography having occurred in
copying twelve letters but if the copyist disregarded three flat'marks,
which seemed to him meaningless, the reading would naturally result.

A different theory as to the cause of these errors in Mss is employed
by Moser throughout his edition, and has been accepted by some other
scholars. It is to the effect that where a letter or group of letters
occurred twice in succession, the letter or group was written larges than
the rest and once only, thus, MoRETUR=moreretur Ι find no au-
thority for this view except an assertion in G. Scioppius, de Arte Cretica,
