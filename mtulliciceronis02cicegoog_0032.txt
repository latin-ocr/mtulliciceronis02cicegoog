INTRODUCTJON ὁ xxvii

evidently correct and which are not found in the mss of group α, but on
the other hand, as shewn a little further on, it presents a great number
os errors, several os which are clearly due to the use os contractioris in
the original from which its corrections were taken.

There is so much difference between the readings os V² 3ηά those
os the mss os group a, that it seems probable that several stages in-
tervened between the two sources of groups α 3ηά β 3ηά their common
archetype.

another. R and Ba are very closely related: as also are R and L 3 so
too are E and B. K is related to R but not quite so closely as either

V is the most independent member ol the group. It is the only
early rus that has not the words iussu tyrannorum alter ponamus in
1575. This ms marks the nearest point of contact between group a
and group β. Hence I think that it has probably been copied from an
earlier rus than that from which the other members olgroup aare
derived.

The inter-relationship ol the most important mss of group β is in-
dicated in the following table :—
