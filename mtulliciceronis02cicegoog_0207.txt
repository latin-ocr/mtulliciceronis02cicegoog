is fully confirmed so sar as the MSS of

4001444444...404411104; i.e. ‘Achilles in
fabula Acciana’ There is not evidence
to shew whether this line occurred in the
Achilles or in some other play of Accius

anim uero: in O.L. an unaccented
vowel before two consonants very osten
remained short where the later rule would
make it long by position. Cs. 804444444-
schein on Plaut. Rudens Arg l. 1.

Hectora abstuli: Ι have two reasons
t'or departing from the mss, which read
Hectorem: (r) because Hectora was Ac-
cius’ usual form, cf. Varro L. L. x 70 Μ.
‘Accius haec in tragoediislargius a prisca
consuetudine mouere coepit etad formas
Graecas uerborum magis reuocare, aquo
Valerius ait: Accius Hectorem nolet ia·
cere, Hectora malet’ quoted in Ribbeck
Frag. 1 p. 446. Cf. also Ribbeck's re·
marks on the quantity 04 Hectoris on
p. 63. (a) Because Cic. in wn'ting
Hectora ln the next line is evidently
repeating Accius’ word. The corruption
is due to the occurrence 04 Hectorem
three times in the preceding context.
Hectorem on the other hand is right in
Ennius, above.

Hectora 4444444414 Hectora rs the 404444
given here by the best and nearly all Mss.
Hectorem, Cic. s usual form, rs adopted
{rom a few inferior MSS by Kl. Sch. and
Μο., but Cic. here repeats with a touch
04 sarcasm Accius’ exact word from the
previous line.

§1⁰st allus: the ghost 04 Deiphilus,
son of Iliona, daughter 04 Priam, and 04
Polymnestor‚ King 04 Thrace, as ex·
plained by Or. Priam having sent his
son Polydorus to Iliona to be brought up
by her, Iliona brought him up as her
own son and brought up Deiphilus, her
son, as her brother. When the Greeks,
victorious at Troy, wished to extirpate
the race of Priam they called on Poly·
mnestor to put Polydorus to death, where-
upon he put Deiphilus to death believing
him to be Polydorus. Hyginus cix. Cf.
Heindorf on Hor. Sat. ii 3, 60 and
Bouhier on this passage. Cic. often
refers to this scene, cf. Ac. ii 47, 88;
Sest. 59, 446.

04 these lines cs. Ribbeck vol. 1, p. 400
and Porphyrion on Horace Sat. ii 3, 60.
As usually printed the lines are iambic
octonarii, but Cicero ἕ 407 below calls
them septenarii. Ktih. Hei. TS. suppose
that Cic. made a mistake as to the metre ;
