Menoeceus: Tiresias had promised

Ares. Menoeceus accordingly slew him·

read by the vulg. after Menoeceus is
absent from most MSS.

qui item: this reading, introduced by
Dav. as an emendation, is found in V by
correction. It has been generally ac·
cepted and is probably right. Mo. reads
‘qui oraculo.¹ qui deorum oraculo may
occur to some one as a probable con-
jecture, and qui deetq. oraculo would very

easily be corrupted by haplography into ,

quideeracul03 but deorum would bear an
unnatural emphasis since oraculum with·
out deorum has just preceded. iterra on
the other hand refers naturally back to
oraculo, and the corruption froin qui r'trm
to quirem, which being meaningless would
be changed into quedem, would be one of
the most usual kind.

Aldine, ‘in Aulis'; abl. of place
where.

but Ribbeck, Scern. Rom. Poesr's Frag.
1 p. 43 (and edn), with more probability
refers the words in the text to Ennius'
Iphigenia.

iubet: sff. alters to iubens putting a

comma only before Iphigenia-a slight
change; but the constr. resulting is
harsh, and in finding the finite verb
iubet ‘uitiosissimum' his objection can
only be that it introduces a new subject
lphrgmia, while rhetores is the subj. be·
fore and after. Against such an objection
it may be pointed out that a change has
begun in praetmrrittitur though rhetores
is still virtually the subject of the action ;
this change is only carried a little further
in Iphigenia...r‘ubet, for this is equivalent
to Iphigeniam iubentem proferunt. Some·
what similar is Juv. vii ι 51 ‘cum perimit
saeuos classis numerosa tyrannos’

ut huetium: sc. sanguis which, though
read by the vulgate, is absent from the
best uss, and cannot, pace Khhnerr', be
supplied from sanguinem of the previous
sentence. But may not sanguis have
formed part of the unquoted context of
the extract?

XLIX. in ore eet: sc. rhetoribus,
implied in ueniunt. est (ἔ) fell out

between e in ore and e in et and was re· ,

stored by Rath; it has since been found
in W 1 before r'n ore.

urget: vulg. urgent. The sing, deal·
ing with each name separately (Riihl, is
more appropriate here. For the meaning

‘Philopem quem in Academia uigere
audio.

non norunt: subject rhetores.

always used in this and similar ex·
