that Theophrastus’ words were πατρῷος
nul παππῳος, as in Demosthenes. Cic.
perhaps wished to reproduce the Gk
rdentity of termination. The reference
is to the early physicists, Thales etc.

dispicere, ‘to pierce the gloom.’ Much
used of making effort to see through
obstacles, eg. scales over the eyes, Fin.
iv23‚ 54, v 15, 43 ormist,as when one
swoons, Fin. ii 30, 97 (of Epaminondas,
mortally wounded) ‘ut primum dispexit’;
or an unfavourable medium, as here.
XX. ahquid: something definite3
hence often as here something consider-
able ; ‘they think they reap some results.’
Cf. iv ao, 46 ‘nihilne tibi uidentur an
aliquid dicerei⁹ iii 16, 35; v 36,104;
Juv. i 73 ‘si uis esse aliquid'; Prop. iv 7,
1 ‘sunt aliquid manes.' Su, more rarely,
aliquis, aliquem. This use is especially
found with esse, dicere, uideri. Similarly
in Greek τις and τι, cf. Liddell and Scott,
rubuere.

adsequi: Kiih. is probably right in
explaining this as a pres. of abiding re·
sult of past action. Cf. Gram. 11 p. 89
§3¹2 5. This use is more common in
Livy, e.g. uincere=nictor esse. Cf. Kuh-
nast, Liv. Synt. ξ 2083 and in the poets
cf. edunt Virg. Ecl. 8, 453 creat Geo. i
2793 dat Aen. ix 266. So in Gk φεύγειν,

νικᾶν. Α Ciceronian parallel seems to be
ii 1, a ‘qui...mortem non timet magnum
is sibi praesidium ad beatam uitam com·
parat’ Yet this latter use is not so
strong as our present one, since he who
does not fear death now may corne to
fear it later on and then hispraesidium
ad beatam uitam is gone: this praesidium
mugi therefore be kept in order from day
to a.
angyusiiu: Hellespont and Bosporus

delecti: the form dilecti is adopted by
Bai. Kuh. Hei. TS. and may very possibly
be right. The evidence of the MSS seems
rather in favour of delecti, but the reading
of V may have been tampered with. The
passage is from Ennius' Medea, repro·
ducing Eur. Med. 5 ἀνδρῶν ἀριστέων, ol
τὸ πάγχρυσον δέραν... Ennius may have
used dilectus in the sense of ‘carefully
chosen’ though the word seems not to
occur elsewhere in this sense; but cf.
diligentia. Nine lines are quoted by the
Auctor ad Herennium ii aa, 35, and he
and Priscian de Metr. Com. p. 1325
quote these lines thus :-‘Argo qua uecti
Argiui; delecti uiri, petebant illam
pellem inauratam arietis.’ Cicero, as
often, does not quote the lines quite
accuratply. arietis scanned dryetis
(dactyl.

Europam Libyamque: the Straits oi
Gibraltar are referred to. This line,
from Enn. Annales, occurs again N.D.

source, Anu. ix frag. 3.
