book of the later edition and forty·eight
chapters of the second book of the earlier
edition survive. There are also some
fragments of the later edition. For all
details with ref. to the history and con-
tents of the two editions see Reid, Acad.
Introd. 54, pp. 28-51.
contentionibus: abl. of cause; ‘had
. it not been stirred to activity by the con·
tests and disputes of the most learned
meu? For nomast cf. Aen. iv. 175
‘fama...mobilitate uiget!

§a munierant: Bai. and sff. follow
Wes. Em. 1 p. 7 in reading traserant,
claiming support from Boetius’ comm. ou
Cicero’s Topica where, towards the end
of Bk v, this passage sed tamen tautum
abest ut scribi ...maiores nostri transtulere
(sic) is quoted, as are also the words nas
qui sequimur probabilr'a...siue iracundia
parati sumus. The form trasrrant is
found in the Med. ΜΒ in Fam. i 4, 1, v uo,
3 etc. Cf. also Kuh. Gr. 1 ὅ 210 p. 626,
28. The support of Boetius is not of
much value as his quotation is inaccurate
in several particulars, but the early cor-
rector of V reads transferant. Sn sar as
meaning is concerned‚ transferant is
quite suitable‚ cf. ‘transtulerunt’ below,
‘traducta’ ἕ 6 etc.

quae omnem mant: the indic. is cor·
rect where definite things (as here def.
branches of literature and not inde·
terminate members o a class are re-
ferred to.

ita...ut: lit. ‘on such terms...that,’
for this limiting use of ita with ut cf.
Hand, Tursell. 111 p. 475.

ab humill...ad summum: the sub·
stantival use of surrentum is usual, cf.
Caes. B.G. vii 73, 6 ‘stipites...ab summo
praeacuti'; the similar use of humili
ere is due to the balance ol clauses.

uenit ad summum cf. Hor. Epp.
ii 1, 3² ‘uenimus ad summum fortunae.’

senescat: cf. Or. ii a, 7 ‘ut laudem
eorum iarn rope senescentem...ab ob·
liuione...uin icarem’

philosophia nascatur: following upon
oratorum quidem we should have ex-

pected a contrasted main clause plu'lo- ,

sophia autam nascitur (and Bent. proposed

pail. nascitur) but Cic. has inaccurately

allowed the latter clause to become de-
pendent upon ut (cf. i36‚ 88 u. on ‘con-
firmato illo’)‚ and this he has done the
morereadilybecausethisriseof philosophy
and the assistance lent thereto by him
wereintimatelyconnected with thedecline
of oratory. To put a semicolon after
uideatur and take nascatur...adiuuemus
...patiamur as ‘imperative’ (‘jussive’)
with Onsr’f. Hei. and TS. would give a
balance of clauses deficient in symmetry.
Cicero would have used a cum· or
quoniam-clause and not a coordinate
clause along with these verbs if that had
been'the meaning intended.

meatur Latinis amnem: quralem, by
emphasizing Latinis, serves to contrast
